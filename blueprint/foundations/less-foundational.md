# Didn't make the cut / Still digesting / Second class citizens

## Individual and collective tensions
There is a significant and difficult to measure value that comes from human connection and belonging.

  - Dignity is derived from human connection & belonging
  - Collaboration over individual excellence
  - Pods are the primary learning unit
  - Use and hold the tension between the individual and the collective. resist the urge to choose one side or another.
  - Minimize self-sacrifice required for collective learning
  - Don't sacrifice the community to honor individuality
  - "I can succeed without you. Your success and mine are related and connected."
  - "I could learn without you. I learn better with you."
  - Value/valorize human connection

## LG and the "real world" work environment
  - Tension between our learning community and their work environment
  - Dignified learning produces a growth in trust, agency, and wisdom.
  - Tie the reality of their behavior to their outcomes.
  - Resist the temptation to make the learning environment shit because the work will be shit and we want to prepare people for shit
  - Prepare people for the forces that will work against them in the work environment
  - Don’t try and change the world to fit our learners
  - I can’t prepare the future for my kids, but I can prepare the kids for the future
  - Rift between individuals dignity and the professional worlds ability to recognize that dignity. The learners need to be able to teach the professional world to acknowledge and honor their dignity.

## Focus on the meta, process over product
- We are more concerned about meta learning and learning than about product and production because our faith is that when people focus on the learning the product will take care of itself
- Invest in meta-learning and non tech skills

## Misc
  - Low stakes learning about high stakes issues
  - Minimize the cost of switching crafts
  - Ecosystem not factory
  - Failure is positive and supported.
  - scale through human relationships
  - Facilitation over Instruction
  - Intentional and selective about what stress we put the learners under
  - Separation of knife and feedback. Player support and assessment are separated. If there’s something that’s going to impact my ability to stay at learners guild it should be separated. (jeffrey thinks this is impossible). Build a firewall or some insulation from the learning environment from the reality that at any moment you could be kicked out
  - Daniel needs to not be dependant on Mr. Miagi.
  - High expectation high support
  - Balance competition and collaboration
  - Encourage and prioritize conceptual understanding.

## Theoretical accuracy over implementation precision

Learners’ proximity to the essential concept is more valuable than proximity to established notions of praxis. If the concept is accurately understood, the embodiment of that concept is of little concern.

Example: we measure learners’ ability to create an object-oriented design, not the language or language features they use to build it.

## Eat your own dog food.

We manage our business culture like we manage our learning culture: embodying in our own practices what we expect from our learners and partners.

The cultural architecture we develop and implement internally for ourselves will serve as the foundation for the learning culture that we offer to our members.

## Imagination trumps knowledge

Programming is not about what you know, it's about what you can figure out.

## Data is not always first

Design decisions are not primarily data driven.

Design is both art and science. Of course we will use as much data as we can get our hands on. But the design will also be informed by:

- Our past individual and collective experience
- Other people's experience and feedback (educators, facilitators, learners, friends.....etc.)
- Our intuition, feelings and best guesses based on thought experiments
- Our sense of aesthetics
- Our guiding principles, beliefs, and world views
- Existing bodies of research (and our biased interpretation of them)
- Deliberately designed feedback loops (both qualitative and quantitative)

So, if you have a very very loose definition of "data" then yes. Otherwise, we are most certainly not primarily data driven.

## Beliefs
  - Learning is a process of integrating and adapting new information into existing knowledge.
