# Player Characteristics

#### Purpose
Define what characteristics are needed and/or useful for players to be successful in the game.

#### Usage
To determine if we should invest in a player (sign a Player-Investor contract), evaluate the candidate according to the following traits:

---

## Required Traits

- A desire to be a software engineer in a supportive but challenging environment.
- A willingness to making a commitment to self-transformation through social-emotional training.
- At least 21 years old (drops to 18 for V1)
  - This gives the pilot pod for the LG game a few less hurdles to face. With the understanding that players who are leveling up from to placed web developers are going to face challenges around race, gender, income and so on. To mitigate the risk of pod failure, we have decided to punt to v1, the challenge of 'ageism.'
- Previous employment history or an alternate demonstration of responsibility
  - We are specifically interested in a demonstration of responsibility that indicates a players ability to navigate family needs, transportation, housing, and co-worker dynamics.
- Availability to participate full-time for 40 weeks

### Nice to have Traits

The relative traits of an ideal player are:
- An identification with a historically underrepresented group in the software engineering workforce like:
  - Women
  - Ethnic-minority
  - LGBTQ, gender non-conforming
  - Persons with disabilities
  - Persons from a low-income environment
- A belief that inclusion is an overall net positive effect in the software engineering field.

## Technical Talent Requirement

### Computational Thinking
The ideal player should come into the game with a technical talent aptitude assessed by the use of validated "computational thinking" and/or "technical talent" assessment.

These assessment should be a simulation which indicates an applicants ability to do:
- Algorithmic notions of control flow
  - Example: Successfully [traversing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cqddqb3mbad04pk/thoughtWorks%20006.jpg?dl=0) a flow chart
- Abstraction
  - Example: Finding the common pattern in different groups of concepts
- Conditional thinking
  - Example: Successfully traversing a flow chart with logic based decisions
- Symbol systems and representation
  - A simple translation task based on a given code system, for example translating from emojis to full sentences
- Problem decomposition
  - Example: how would you tell someone to draw a face
    - Level 1: Tell them to draw a face. The problem cannot be abstracted much more than this.
    - Level 2: Divide the face into components (eyes, ears, nose, mouth) and tell them to draw the specific components. Note that you need instructions to describe spatial relationships.
    - Level 3: Describe the face as a series of line segments or arcs in particular locations, lengths and orientations.
    - Level 4: Describe the face as a set of points that are drawn (stippling). Each point is defined by an (x, y) position.
- Iterative thinking
  - Some have argued the addition of recursive and parallel thinking, but I believe these can be scaffolded on iterative thinking

Examples of assessment materials can be found at [CS unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/), [Bebras](http://www.bebraschallenge.org/), as well as other resources that cater to a development of computational thinking. Similar assessment of "algorithmic notions of control flow" have been developed by Thoughtworks corporation. These assessments have proved to be a strong indicator of software engineering aptitude.

### Programming
The ideal player should come into the games with a minimum of 40 to 50 hours of prior programming knowledge as defined along the following dimensions:
- Programming Experience (Crude understanding of):
  - Loops
  - Arrays / lists
  - Functions
  - Object Oriented Programming

### Web Development
- Web Development Experience (Crude understanding of):
  - HTTP methods
  - Databases
  - Encryption
  - Web Services API

### Language
- Language Experience (Fluency with):
  - English


### Nice to have

In addition to the technical talent requirements, the ideal player would benefit from having familiarity with

  - Programming languages:
    - HTML/CSS
    - Python
    - Ruby
    - JavaScript
    - SQL


## Non-Technical Talent Requirement
The ideal player should come into the games with the following non-negotiable disposition defined along the following dimensions:

### Grit
  - They can share a brief description of a struggle they have faced in their education or career thus far.
  - They can discuss their own motivations and goals, and can share a personal story of putting in serious, sustained effort towards an outcome.
  - They have overcome setbacks to conquer an important challenge.

### Self Reflection
  - They can tell of a time when they were proud of their actions
  - They can tell of a time when they were disappointed in their own conduct.
    - They can elaborate on that disappointment by sharing what action(s) they wished you had taken.

### Growth Mindset
  - They should have a an understanding that intelligence is malleable.
  - They should have a an understanding that deliberate practice expands intelligence.

### Passion
  - They have an insatiable excitement and curiosity regarding the craft of software development.

### Distance Travelled
Distance travelled is a concept that seeks to quantify the path of a potential applicant outside of orthodox ability measurements like GPA, SAT and so forth. It is a recognition of the progress a potential learners has made that may not be visible when compared to traditional learners. A consideration of distance travelled is very important in contextualizing potential Applicants’ achievements.
  - They can share where they came from to where they are in terms of their knowledge
    - Example:
      - I dropped out of high school in the 10th grade, with a 2.4 GPA. Since then, I have taken the GED, applied to community college, and finished with a 3.0 GPA.

### Nice to have

In addition to grit, a growth mindset and an ability to perform light self-reflection, it would be beneficial if a player came into the games with the following disposition defined along the following dimensions:

- Adaptability
  - They know what their boundaries are, and how/when to extend them.
  - They are open and tolerant of ideas and approaches different from theirs.
  - They can draw from the unique nature of individual cultural backgrounds.
- Group Spirit
  - They understand doing things in a collaborative mode.
  - They understand the compromises and inconveniences that are required to be a part of a group.
  - They are willing to slow down, in order to go farther together.
- Creativity / Resourcefulness
  - They are not constrained by the way they were initially taught when seeking solutions.
  - They have a good sense of play and spirit of playfulness.
  - They are aware of different forms of creativity
- Leadership
  - They should be able to tell of a time when they took it upon themselves to get something done.
- Community service
  - They should be able demonstrate a prior experience of community service.
