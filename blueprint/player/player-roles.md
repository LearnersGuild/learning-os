# Player roles

## Aspirant
An Aspirant is an individual who has expressed interest in joining Learners Guild, but has not yet become part of a Pod. She has not yet been vetted by existing Players (v0: LG Partners) as meeting the baseline criteria required to become a Player.

## Player In Prep (PIP)
An aspirant person who is accepted into the game, but hasn't started playing it yet.

## Learner
A Learner is an individual playing the game. She will follow her own path through the terrain in the game and will advance from level to level as she does so. She will initially be a member of a single Pod, but (as she advances in the game) will also become part of other Pods in her capacity as a Mentor (see below).

## Mentor
Players who have been playing the game for long enough will also be Mentors. Mentors are responsible for helping other Players in the game who are playing at lower levels. It will not be possible to win the game without Mentoring other Players as they move through the terrain of the game.
