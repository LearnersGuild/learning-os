# Foundations

Foundations should guide why and how a feature is added, and should serve as an integration test before any new features are accepted.

They are the foundations upon which our entire design rests. The **beliefs**, **philosophies**, **principles**, **concepts**, **strategies** and **design guidelines** that underlie our LOS? [^1]

## Don't build a school. Cultivate a learning community.

The OS is the soil in which a learning community grows and thrives. Not a factory/machine that makes workers.

  - Don't iterate on what's out there. We need a radical solution. A different category. A paradigm shift
  - Don't build a bigger better bootcamp. A school, by any other name, would smell as bad
  - Schools are built. Communities are grown
  - Schools have central control. Communities have distributed control
  - Schools are organized by administration and teachers. Communities are self organizing
  - Conceptualize our learning community as distributed across multiple locations
  - Think of the practitioners and learning facilitators as paid members of the community, not LG staff
  - Design for transformation not transmission
  - Take a risk with your design
    - Examine and eliminate all assumptions. Resist the gravitational pull of what's been done before
    - Start at first principles, and change things at the roots
    - Be bold. The design should feel dangerous. It should inspire you, and slightly scare you

## Prioritize Scale over quality
At the core of a for profit education business is a trade off between quality and scale. Learners Guild's mission is to build highly scalable learning communities. We approach our design with the question: “How can this highly scalable design be of excellent quality?” rather than “How can this excellent quality design scale?”.

Any feature too complex to scale (for example, if it depends on rockstar, highly talented individuals) should be cut.

## Align incentives
As much as possible, the design should align the success of learners and LG. The game mechanics should setup win-win scenarios where a leaner's ongoing success correlate to each others success and to LG's success.

  - Align financial incentives
	  - Financial success of learners guild depends on learners retention of dignified employment
	  - Financial incentives of learners should be aligned
  - Conceptualize education as investment not as service
    - Conceptualize of LG as an incubator not a school
    - Conceptualize the Pod as a startup, not a group of students
  - Align individual objectives, with what's good for the learning environment. Instead of demanding benevolence of our learners, the system should align with personal self interest to create a benevolent emergent environment.
	- Success on the job and success at LG are the same thing
    "It’s basically covered by taking the responsibility on us to create the benevolent culture, not asking learners to necessarily be benevolent.  Meaning any skill that we require of them to learn/demonstrate needs to be for their own good with the express purpose of attaining a dignified livelihood, and not bleed in other purposes, eg: Disrupting education, creating a learning environment for everyone, making Learner’s Guild an awesome place.  These things are our responsibility, not the players'"
  - The business and community support each other

## Build it as a team game
Play is the optimal state for learning. We have been making up games, playing them, and learning from them since before we could talk or walk! So, let's build a game.

Since the OS is optimized for skills that require people to build things together, the game should be built and designed for co-operative, team-based play.

  - Follow a Game Enhanced Learning design methodology
  - Express the protocols, agents, artifacts, environments, and goals using game mechanics like player stats, discoverables, collectibles, maps, quests, challenges, rapid feedback loops, etc.
  - Design Tight feedback loops
  - Reality is the assessor
	- Design for team play
	- Foster teamwork

## Trust the learner
The dominant education paradigm is built on a fear and mistrust of the learner. A more generative and effective approach is to assume the fundamental trustworthiness and goodness of people and design accordingly.

Education should be built on a fundamental trust in people. People will rise or fall to the degree that they feel trusted. We approach everything with a developmental mindset. Design a system based on the belief that everyone has inherent potential that may not yet have been realized.

  - Assume that they are willing and able to learn and take responsibility for their own learning
  - Embrace the view that human nature is basically good and design for earnest, well intentioned and honest players
  - Trusting in the natural unfolding of human development
  - Assume individuals possess virtually unlimited potential for growth
  - Assume the learner’s experience is a rich resource for learning
  - We are not the learners' heroes or rescuers. Resist the temptation to save them.
  - Don’t demand that people be good. Assume they are, and create rules of engagement and a culture that organically bring the best OUT of people."
  - While we're at it, also trust the learning facilitator, the practitioner, the investor...etc.
  - Resist the urge to blame the learner
  - Trust in each person’s ability and right to manage their own life,


## Enable self-organization & self-determination

Humans are motivated most strongly by the need for autonomy, growth, and purpose. Autonomy means that one can and does set one's own rules, and can choose for oneself the norms one will respect and what has value.  

Ensure tools support personal choice and freedom as well as responsibility for those choices. Everyone should have the opportunity to participate in designing and upgrading the structures which guide them.

- Decentralize authority
- Maximize autonomy, personal agency and responsibility
  - Maximize learners capacity to participate in shaping their experience
  - Learners should decide when, where and how they learn, and what they are learning
  - Authorship of the education falls on the learner
  - Community should be largely self-organizing
  - Amplify Agency
- We are not the learners' parents. Resist the parental approach to education.
  - We are a kitchen, not a restaurant. Resist the "education as a service" orientation.
  - No coercion
    - Resist the urge to coerce, direct, manipulate, force, reward & punish
    - No required curriculum, mandates or forced support
    - Induce behavior through feedback, offers and suggestions
    - Player Support and challenges are always offered, never imposed
  - Build peer to peer accountability structures
  - Learners are responsible for their physical environment
  - Give learners autonomy over their pace
  - Design for a large solution space
  - Prioritize learners’ abilities to self-teach, develop mindfulness, and organize within their pod over their adherence to a defined set of instructions.
  - Provide guidance and mentorship not content delivery and enforcement of predefined linear progress.
  - Don’t abdicate your authority. Own your authority while supporting their autonomy. 

## Feedback should flow like wine
  - Focus on the feedback loops
  - Create culture through feedback
  - Create a culture of feedback
  - Real. Immediate. Unfiltered.
  - Transparency
  - Directness
  - Radical honesty
  - Let everyone in back stage
  - Give people the truth so they can make good decisions
  - The only wrong with our world is broken feedback systems
  - Consequence is a form of feedback


## Optimize for agility
  - Keep things simple. Complexity is the enemy
  - OS should be craft [^2] agnostic
  - Invest in meta-learning and non tech skills
  - Minimum viable structure and rules
  - Don't scar easily. Rules are an expensive and bulky way to prevent mistakes from being repeated. Don't implement a feature because one person, one time, needed it. Anecdotes are not patterns
  - Great design is fractal. Design elements apply to multiple levels and hint at the holographic nature of the world.
  - We approach the a working/learning environment as a complex system emergent from simple rules, more than a complicated one defined by comprehensive rules.
  - Don't optimize prematurely
  - Design for frictionless participation
  - Minimize time/energy/resources for Pods to launch
  - Expand pods first. Keep chapters thin
  - Unbundle roles: Design each role with the minimum viable set of accountabilities (single responsibility principle)
  - Modular design

## Simulation not preparation
We learn by doing. When training in a craft, the skills being practiced should approximate/simulate the "real world" as closely as possible.

That is not to say the the learning environment should be an exact copy of a typical work environment. There are many things about traditional work environments that would hinder learning (gossip, racism, a micromanaging boss, a focus on shipping shitty code fast...etc.). Simulation not replication.

The focus should be on simulating “real-world” projects/exercises more than we fabricate contrived preparation exercises. The pace, structure, and cycles of work in the industry are approximated as best as possible.

For example, apprentice programmers should receive feedback on their code through code reviews; projects should be structured and managed using industry standard tools and practices. Another example is that learners should practice interviewing through "mock interviews"

- Learn by doing
- Skills not knowledge
- Approach each challenge as if it was a work deliverable. The primary difference is that the product is your learning.
- Simulate real world situations, projects and problems.
- Learners should know how to deliver in a work environment.
- Simulation not replication
- Simulate "real life" work in the professional world
- Co-create dignified livelihood from day 1
- Learners Guild should be the experience of dignified livelihood from beginning to end. Don't simulate dignified livelihood, be an ACTUAL dignified livelihood

Can we create/support an environment that does not shield learners from the possible dysfunctions of work life, and enables them to become so familiar with another mode of life that when they encounter dysfunction they are not thrown off, and also do not become part of it?
