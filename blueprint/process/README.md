# Development Process

This section defines the framework for our design and development process. It addresses such questions as:

- How is the life cycle of a design idea?
- What is the process for proposing a new design idea?
- How do we frame our design discussions to be intentional without losing creative potency?

The design process is a cycle of addressing a design issue.

Design issues are stored and managed through [Github Issues][github-issues].

## How to Engage With the Process

### Getting Your Bearings

- Read about the [Seven Levels of Thought](seven-levels-of-thought.md) in which a design issue may exist.
- Read about the [Versions](versions.md) of our pedagogy, and when they'll be rolled out.
- Read about how we use [Game Design](game-design.md) as a framework.
- Read about how we use [Scrum](scrum.md) to manage our work together.
- Read about [Game v.s. Player Support](../../support/README.md)
