# Game Design

#### Purpose
An understanding of why and how we are using Game-Enhanced Learning (GEL).

#### Usage
Read this document to familiarize with the basics of our GEL approach.

---

The learning environment is designed as a game in accordance with Game-Enhanced Learning (GEL) principles.

We are designing an Applied Game. Our LOS is a game that we design and which our learners play.

We are going to setup our learning community as a multi-player, in person, real-life applied game.

We're going to use game language and mechanics to setup the rules of engagement and our curriculum.

We are responsible for designing both the [game](../../game/README.md) and the [player support](../../support/README.md).

For more information about how to differentiate the two, read [the support README](../../support/README.md)

#### What we're not building

We are not going to build a virtual world, or a video game, or an online game.

We are not a traditional teaching environment with badges, leaderboards, and points thrown in to "gamify" things.

#### Qualities of a Game

A Game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude. Play is manipulation that satisfies curiosity.

- Games are entered willfully.
- Games have goals.
- Games have conflict.
- Games have rules.
- Games can be won and lost.
- Games are interactive.
- Games have challenge.
- Games can create their own internal value.
