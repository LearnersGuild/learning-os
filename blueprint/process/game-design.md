# Game Design

The learning environment is designed as a game in accordance with Game-Enhanced Learning (GEL) principles.

We are designing an Applied Game. Our LOS is a game that we design and which our learners play.

We are going to setup our learning community as a multi-player, in person, real-life applied game.

We're going to use game language and mechanics to setup the rules of engagement and our curriculum.

We are responsible for designing both the [game components](#game-components) (mechanics and terrain) and the [player support](#player-support) (strategies and resources).

#### What we're not building

We are not going to build a virtual world, or a video game, or a online game.

We are not a traditional teaching environment with badges, leaderboards, and points thrown in to "gamify" things.

#### Qualities of a Game

A Game is a problem-solving activity, approached with a playful attitude. Play is manipulation that satisfies curiosity.

- Games are entered willfully.
- Games have goals.
- Games have conflict.
- Games have rules.
- Games can be won and lost.
- Games are interactive.
- Games have challenge.
- Games can create their own internal value.
- Games engage players.
- Games are closed, formal systems.

## Game Components

The components of the game determine what the game is and how it is played.

Components are expressed in the **Rule Book** and encoded in software.

The components fall into two categories:

1. [Mechanics](#mechanics): _how the game works_. The system rules that govern how the game works, encoded as software.
1. [Terrain](#terrain): _where the game is played_. The interface for gameplay, including resources for advancement.

### Mechanics

_how the game works_

The game mechanics determine how the game functions and how players advance through the game.

Game mechanics are encoded into our software and contracts, and explained the **Rule Book**. In the game of poker, the mechanics are the rules of different poker games.

Examples of mechanics:

- Point system
- Player stats
- How players join
- Victory conditions
- Advancement and leveling up
- How/when players leave
- How money works
- Contracts, protocols, formal agreements
- Modification and customization options
- Player roles (e.g. mentor)

### Terrain

_where the game is played and which resources are available there_

The terrain is the interface, or arena, where the game is played. This includes the levels, challenges, quests, problems that players/teams need to solve in order to win/level up.

Terrain is encoded as data, explained in the **Rule Book**, and exposed to players through a text or graphic UI. In the game of poker, the terrain is the cards, chips, and the poker table.

Examples of terrain and terrain elements:

- Levels and level "bosses"
- Challenges (outcomes-oriented objectives)
- Quests / missions
- Achievements
- Game resources
- Player-to-player and player-to-mentor communication channels

## Player Support

Player support is auxiliary to the game itself but critical to thriving and successful players and pods.

Support available to players and pods is expressed and explained in the **Player Field Guide**.

Support comes in two categories:

1. [Strategies](#strategies): _how to play the game well_. Guidelines and heuristics for players, pods, mentors, and facilitators.
1. [Resources](#resources): _what is needed to ensure player success_. External resources for supporting players and pods.

### Strategies

_how to play the game well_

The strategies, guidelines, and heuristics for players and pods that instruct them in the proper ways to engage with and succeed at the game. They are both learner- and mentor-facing.

Strategies are expressed in the **Player Field Guide** and encoded as the learning culture (i.e. in person-to-person interactions). In poker, strategies are captured in how-to books and in the norms and habits of successful players.

Examples of strategies:

- Mentorship strategies
- Pair programming habits
- Heuristics for logical reasoning
- 11 learning architecture principles
- Right mindset
- Conflict resolution
- Teamwork guide

### Resources

_what and who is needed to ensure player success_

We resource the players with support to accomplish their game objectives. We provide training, workshops, facilitation, coaching, mentoring, and materials that set the players up for success in the game.

Resources are encoded in the **Player Field Guide** and in contracts and agreements between stakeholders. In poker, some resources include money, a coach, and a gambler's anonymous group.

Examples of resources:

- Stipend funds
- Game moderation
- Facilities (real estate, computers, desks, chairs, etc.)
- Facilitation (guided group and individual facilitation to support success)
- External services to support learners' lives in order that they can show up to play
- Trainings (workshops, events, etc. that help players level up in order to play better)
- Supporting material (maps, guides, tutorials, written/recorded curricula that help the players play better)
