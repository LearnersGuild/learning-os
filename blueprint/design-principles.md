# Design Principles

Design Principles should guide why and how a feature is added, and should serve as an integration test before any new features are accepted.
They describe the outcome of the design. The OS itself. They are used as things that must not be violated, it doesn't mean that every issue that is merged needs to inculde all of these. They are not design elements they are principles.

The **beliefs**, **philosophies**, **principles**, **concepts**, **strategies** and **design guidelines** that underlie our LOS? [^1]


> "Be bold, and mighty forces will come to your aid."

## Cultivate a learning collective

The OS is the soil in which a learning collective grows and thrives. Not a factory/machine that makes workers.

  - Don't iterate on what's out there. We need a radical solution. A different category. A paradigm shift
  - Take a risk with your design. Be bold. The design should feel dangerous. It should inspire you, and slightly scare you    
  - Start at first principles, and change things at the roots. Examine and eliminate all assumptions. Resist the gravitational pull of what's been done before
  - Don't get stuck building a bigger better bootcamp
  - Conceptualize our learning collective as distributed across multiple locations
  - Design for transformation not transmission
  - We are a kitchen, not a restaurant. Resist the "education as a service" orientation  

## Prioritize Scale over quality

At the core of a for profit education business is a trade off between quality and scale. Learners Guild's mission is to build highly scalable learning collectives. We approach our design with the question: “How can this highly scalable design be of excellent quality?” rather than “How can this excellent quality design scale?”.

Any feature too complex to scale (for example, if it depends on rockstar, highly talented individuals) should be cut.

## Align incentives

As much as possible, the design should align the success of learners and LG. The game mechanics should setup win-win scenarios where a leaner's ongoing success correlate to each others success and to LG's success.

  - Align financial incentives
  - Conceptualize education as investment not as service
  - Don’t demand that people be benevolent. Instead, the system should align with personal self interest to create a benevolent emergent environment.
  - Watch out for objective creep. Don't impose your objectives/values/worldeview (or LGs) on the learner
  - Minimize the requirements on the learner that benefit us and not them

## Build a team game

Play is the optimal state for learning. We have been making up games, playing them, and learning from them since before we could talk or walk! So, let's build a game.

Since the OS is optimized for skills that require people to build things together[^1], the game should be built and designed for co-operative, team-based play.

  - Follow a Game Enhanced Learning design methodology
  - Design for team play
	- Foster teamwork

## Trust people's intentions and potential

The dominant education paradigm is built on a fear and mistrust of the learner. A more generative and effective approach is to assume the fundamental trustworthiness and goodness of people and design accordingly.

Education should be built on a fundamental trust in people. People will rise or fall to the degree that they feel trusted. We approach everything with a developmental mindset. Design a system based on the belief that everyone has inherent potential that may not yet have been realized.

  - Assume people are willing and able to take responsibility for their own learning
  - Design for earnest, well intentioned and honest players
  - Assume people possess virtually unlimited potential for growth
  - Assume the learner’s experience is a rich resource for learning
  - Trust in each person’s ability and right to manage their own life
  - LG staff are people too. Trust them

## Enable self-organization & self-determination

Humans are motivated most strongly by the need for autonomy, growth, and purpose. Autonomy means that one can and does set one's own rules, and can choose for oneself the norms one will respect and what has value.  

Ensure tools support personal choice and freedom as well as responsibility for those choices. Everyone should have the opportunity to participate in designing and upgrading the structures which guide them.

- Maximize autonomy, personal agency and responsibility
  - Maximize learners capacity to participate in shaping their experience
  - Learners should decide when, where and how they learn, and what they are learning
  - Authorship of the education falls on the learner
  - Collective should be largely self-organizing
- Maximize collective accountability
- Decentralize authority
 - Self organizing doesn't mean there is no authority. It means that authority is earned rather than conferred.
 - Don’t abdicate your authority. Own your authority while supporting their autonomy.
 - Allow for expertise, skill differentials, and power differentials. Just don't force them.
- Decentralize power. Doesn't mean no power differentials, just that it's not too concentrated
- Doesn't mean no structure. Just that players get to co-create it, and structure is offered not imposed
- This doesn't mean no hierarchy or hierarchy. Both are included
- This doesn't mean decentralized or centralized decision making. Both are included
- This doesn't mean democracy or no democracy. Both are included
- No coercion (the broccoli principle)
  - We are not the learners' parents. Resist the parental approach to education
  - Resist the urge to coerce, direct, manipulate, force, reward & punish
  - No required curriculum, mandates or forced support
  - Induce behavior through feedback, offers and suggestions
  - Player Support and challenges are always offered, never imposed
  - Learners are responsible for their physical environment (they won't sign leases, but they should do their own dishes)
  - Give learners autonomy over their pace
- Design for a large solution space
- Provide guidance and mentorship not content delivery and enforcement of predefined linear progress.

## Map feedback loops

  - Build tight, direct, transparent feedback loops
  - Create culture through feedback.
  - Create a culture of feedback
  - Let everyone in back stage
  - Be radically honest with people so they can make good decisions

## Optimize for agility
  - Keep things simple. Complexity is the enemy
  - OS should be craft [^2] agnostic
  - Invest in meta-learning and non tech skills
  - Minimum viable structure and rules
  - Don't scar easily. Rules are an expensive and bulky way to prevent mistakes from being repeated. Don't implement a feature because one person, one time, needed it. Anecdotes are not patterns
  - Great design is fractal. Design elements apply to multiple levels and hint at the holographic nature of the world.
  - We approach the a working/learning environment as a complex system emergent from simple rules, more than a complicated one defined by comprehensive rules.
  - Don't optimize prematurely
  - Design for frictionless participation
  - Minimize time/energy/resources for Pods to launch
  - Unbundle roles: Design each role with the minimum viable set of accountabilities (single responsibility principle)
  - Modular design

## Simulation not preparation

We learn by doing. When training in a craft, the skills being practiced should approximate/simulate the "real world" as closely as possible.

That is not to say the the learning environment should be an exact copy of a typical work environment. There are many things about traditional work environments that would hinder learning (gossip, racism, a micromanaging boss, a focus on shipping shitty code fast...etc.). Simulation not replication.

The focus should be on simulating “real-world” projects/exercises more than we fabricate contrived preparation exercises. The pace, structure, and cycles of work in the industry are approximated as best as possible.

For example, apprentice programmers should receive feedback on their code through code reviews; projects should be structured and managed using industry standard tools and practices. Another example is that learners should practice interviewing through "mock interviews"

- Learn by doing
- Skills not knowledge
- Approach each challenge as if it was a work deliverable. The primary difference is that the product is your learning.
- Simulate real world situations, projects and problems.
- Learners should know how to deliver in a work environment.
- Co-create dignified livelihood from day 1
- Real world performance is the assessment

Can we create/support an environment that does not shield learners from the possible dysfunctions of work life, and enables them to become so familiar with another mode of life that when they encounter dysfunction they are not thrown off, and also do not become part of it?

## Sustain the tension between individual and collective gain

- Design for flux, dynamism and tension between individual self interest and collective gain
- Minimize self-sacrifice required for collective [^3] learning
- Don't sacrifice the collective for the individual
- Resist the urge to choose one side or another
- Dignity is derived from human connection & belonging
- "I can succeed without you. Your success and mine are related and connected."
- "I could learn without you. I learn better with you."

There is a significant and difficult to measure value that comes from human connection and belonging.

There is a tension between personal freedom and social restraint, but to be in balance we must maintain this tension, knowing that some circumstances call for an emphasis on individuality while in different situations we need to place the good (or the wisdom) of the collective whole above personal desires.

Total individualism views society only as an oppressive force— any collaborative communal endeavor is rejected as a mindless “collectivism.” This is an imbalanced and partial perspective, because many vitally important endeavors require collaborative effort— a generous give and take rather than unyielding self-assertion. But too much emphasis on social, cultural or political unification gives us standardization and technocracy, if not outright dictatorship.

Dewey had it right: Genuine democracy is a dynamic tension between self and society, a continual rebalancing and reconstruction that honors both authentic individuality and a common good that asks individuals to look beyond
themselves. It is engaged intelligence, not fixed ideology, that enables us to judge how much emphasis to give to one aspect or another in each situation.
