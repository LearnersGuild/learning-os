## Balance and Sustain creative tensions

We want answers to life’s mysteries and incompleteness, and find them in beliefs, abstractions, and ideologies. Then we hold onto these answers firmly, desperately, and often obsessively, even in the face of new evidence or experience.

The world as we experience it is not fixed but fluid, not absolute but contingent, and when we harden our suppositions and beliefs into rigid ideological positions, we become incapable of growing, learning, or adapting,

To hold onto rigid beliefs because they’re comforting is to forfeit our intelligence.

Any theory or method that we hold too tightly will give us a partial vision of the whole and limit our ability to respond authentically to the spontaneity of the teaching moment.

Balance does not mean compromise. It is not a static blend of opposites that washes the vitality out of them all, but a dynamic relationship between them. It is holding the tension between choices that appear incompatible in order to achieve wholeness or integration at higher levels.

There is a tension between personal freedom and social restraint, but to be in balance we must maintain this tension, knowing that some circumstances call for an emphasis on individuality while in different situations we need to place the good (or the wisdom) of the communal whole above our personal desires.

- Resist the “quest for certainty”
- Balance individual autonomy and collective identity/cohesivness
- Balance individual self-interest and collective gain
- Balance facilitation and instruction
- Balance innovation with what has worked in the past
- Balance transformation with transmission
- Balance freedom and structure
- Balance aimless play and the relentless pursuit of a predetermined goal
- Balance free exploration/play and directed rigor
- Balance chaos and order
- Balance Autonomy and Alignment

> "Too much hierarchical control, and participants become passive and dependent or hostile and resistant. They wane in self-direction, which is the core of all learning. Too much cooperative guidance may degenerate into a subtle kind of nurturing oppression, and may deny the group the benefits of totally autonomous learning. Too much autonomy for participants and laissez-faire on your part, and they may wallow in ignorance, misconception, and chaos." ~ John Heron

## Sustain the social dilemma (tension between Individual self-interest and collective gain)

There is a tension between personal freedom and social restraint, but to be in balance we must maintain this tension, knowing that some circumstances call for an emphasis on individuality while in different situations we need to place the good (or the wisdom) of the communal whole above our personal desires. Total individualism (as found inAyn Rand’s writings, for example) views society only as an oppressive force— any collaborative communal endeavor is rejected as a mindless “collectivism.” This is an imbalanced and partial perspective, because many vitally important endeavors require collaborative effort— a generous give and take rather than unyielding self-assertion. But too much emphasis on social, cultural or political unification gives us standardization and technocracy, if not outright dictatorship. Dewey had it right: Genuine democracy is a dynamic tension between self and society, a continual rebalancing and reconstruction that honors both authentic individuality and a common good that asks individuals to look beyond
themselves. It is engaged intelligence, not fixed ideology, that enables us to judge how much emphasis to give to one aspect or another in each situation.


There is a significant and difficult to measure value that comes from human connection and belonging.

  - Dignity is derived from human connection & belonging
  - Collaboration over individual excellence
  - Pods are the primary learning unit
  - Use and hold the tension between the individual and the collective. resist the urge to choose one side or another.
  - Minimize self-sacrifice required for collective learning
  - Don't sacrifice the community to honor individuality
  - "I can succeed without you. Your success and mine are related and connected."
  - "I could learn without you. I learn better with you."
  - Value/valorize human connection

## LG and the "real world" work environment
  - Tension between our learning community and their work environment
  - Dignified learning produces a growth in trust, agency, and wisdom.
  - Tie the reality of their behavior to their outcomes.
  - Resist the temptation to make the learning environment shit because the work will be shit and we want to prepare people for shit
  - Prepare people for the forces that will work against them in the work environment
  - Don’t try and change the world to fit our learners
  - I can’t prepare the future for my kids, but I can prepare the kids for the future
  - Rift between individuals dignity and the professional worlds ability to recognize that dignity. The learners need to be able to teach the professional world to acknowledge and honor their dignity.

## Focus on the meta, process over product
- We are more concerned about meta learning and learning than about product and production because our faith is that when people focus on the learning the product will take care of itself
- Invest in meta-learning and non tech skills

## Misc
  - Low stakes learning about high stakes issues
  - Minimize the cost of switching crafts
  - Ecosystem not factory
  - Failure is positive and supported.
  - scale through human relationships
  - Facilitation over Instruction
  - Intentional and selective about what stress we put the learners under
  - Separation of knife and feedback. Player support and assessment are separated. If there’s something that’s going to impact my ability to stay at learners guild it should be separated. (jeffrey thinks this is impossible). Build a firewall or some insulation from the learning environment from the reality that at any moment you could be kicked out
  - Daniel needs to not be dependant on Mr. Miagi.
  - High expectation high support
  - Balance competition and collaboration
  - Encourage and prioritize conceptual understanding
  - Support Collaborative Knowledge Construction
  - Respect for every person, including children (human rights)
  - Balance (openness rather than fixed ideology)
  - Decentralization of authority (human scale democracy)
  - A holistic or integral perspective
  - Separate support and evaluation
  - We are a vocational learning community. Resist the urge to sneak in a liberal arts agenda.
  - Don't teach a person to fish, create a community where she can learn to learn anything.
  - Don’t Just Teach Content, Explain the Learning Process
  - Learners create the learning map, and practitioners serve as the compass
  - Self determination, and self direction


## Theoretical accuracy over implementation precision

Learners’ proximity to the essential concept is more valuable than proximity to established notions of praxis. If the concept is accurately understood, the embodiment of that concept is of little concern.

Example: we measure learners’ ability to create an object-oriented design, not the language or language features they use to build it.

## Eat your own dog food.

We manage our business culture like we manage our learning culture: embodying in our own practices what we expect from our learners and partners.

The cultural architecture we develop and implement internally for ourselves will serve as the foundation for the learning culture that we offer to our members.

## Imagination trumps knowledge

Programming is not about what you know, it's about what you can figure out.

## Data is not always first

Design decisions are not primarily data driven.

Design is both art and science. Of course we will use as much data as we can get our hands on. But the design will also be informed by:

- Our past individual and collective experience
- Other people's experience and feedback (educators, facilitators, learners, friends.....etc.)
- Our intuition, feelings and best guesses based on thought experiments
- Our sense of aesthetics
- Our guiding principles, beliefs, and world views
- Existing bodies of research (and our biased interpretation of them)
- Deliberately designed feedback loops (both qualitative and quantitative)

So, if you have a very very loose definition of "data" then yes. Otherwise, we are most certainly not primarily data driven.

## Beliefs
  - Learning is a process of integrating and adapting new information into existing knowledge.


## Agile Learning Centers Principles

### Infinite Play: Play infinitely, grow infinitely..

Play is one of the most powerful paths to growth. The concept of infinite play reminds us that games aren’t about winning; changing rules and boundaries is part of playing, letting players constantly expand the game of outrageous personal growth to incorporate new players and new frontiers.

### Be Agile:

Make tools and practices flexible, adaptable, easy to change… or change back again. Too much change all at once can be disorienting -- try gentle changes over multiple iterations to see what’s working.

### Amplify Agency

Ensure tools support personal choice and freedom as well as responsibility for those choices. Everyone should have the opportunity to participate in designing and upgrading the structures which guide them.

### Culture Creation
Acknowledge and use the water you’re swimming in. We shape culture; culture shapes us. A powerful, positive culture is the strongest, most pervasive support structure a learning community can have.  Develop collective mastery rather than restrictive rule-making. Intentional culture building supports intentionality in other domains as well.


### Visible Feedback
Make choices, patterns, and outcomes visible to participants so they can tune their future behavior accordingly. Make the implicit explicit and expand transparency. These practices empower and build trust among community members.

### Facilitate

Clarify, simplify, and connect. Don’t introduce unnecessary complexity. Hold coherence for personal growth in an empowered cultural context. Connect kids to the larger social capital of their community as they seek learning resources. Combine many principles and intentions into a single tool or practice, instead of trying to maintain more of them.

### Support
Provide maximum support with minimal interference. As adults, we often need support reaching our goals and fulfilling our intentions; so do children. We create supportive structures, practices, culture, and environments. However it’s important to remember that support is not direction -- it does not mean making their decisions for them or intervening and managing their processes. Support that takes up too much space becomes counterproductive.

### Respect each other’s time and space
Hold no unnecessary meetings. Keep all meetings tight, productive and participatory. Honor commitments, as well as scheduled start and end times for happenings. Check-in before creating work for someone else. Be thoughtful about taking up shared space.

### Relationship
Be real. Be accepting. Respect differences. Authentic relationship is the basis of partnership, communication, collaboration, and trust between students and staff. Support self-expression, self-knowledge and self-acceptance, letting the experience of nurturing relationship teach the power of interrelatedness and community.

### Full-spectrum Fluency
Embrace multiple intelligences, modes of expression, and learning styles. Nurture multiple literacies. A functional education for today’s world needs to focus on more than just “book-learning” textual, numerical, analytical, or memorization skills. Social, relational, digital, and a variety of other skill sets are now essential; recognize and develop them as such.

### Shareable Value
Make value received from learning visible and sharable. Use tracking systems, record measurable progress, generate documentation (blogs, portfolios, images), and teach others.

### Safe Space-making
Provide an environment of physical, social, and emotional safety. Set and keep critical boundaries. Foster great freedom within an appropriate frame of safety and legality, so that kids’ energy can be freed up to focus on learning instead of protecting themselves.

## Life Long learning

- Learning should take place in the context of authentic, complex problems (because
learners will refuse to quietly listen to someone else’s answers to someone else’s
questions) [Bruner, 1996].
- Learning should be embedded in the pursuit of intrinsically rewarding activities
[Csikszentmihalyi, 1990].
- Informal learning activities are equally important in lifelong learning and in formal
learning activities [Bransford, 2005].
- Learning often takes place without teaching [Illich, 1971; Wenger, 1998].
- Learning-on-demand needs to be supported because change is inevitable, complete
coverage is impossible, and obsolescence is unavoidable [Fischer, 1991].
- Organizational and collaborative learning must be supported because the individual
human mind is limited [Arias et al., 2000].
- Skills and processes that support learning as a lifetime habit must be developed
[Gardner, 1991].
- Lifelong learning is more than training and more than school learning [Fischer, 2000]


## Paragogical principles
Each of these principles adjusts one of Knowles's  ve principles to the peer-based learning context, often by turning the original by 90°. This is not because we particularly disagree with Knowles about how to teach (see Section 2.2), but because paragogy deals with a very di erent challenge, that of analyzing and co-creating the educational environment as a whole.

1. Context as a decentered center.  For learning design in a peer-to-peer context, understanding the learner's self-concept   in particular, whether they see themselves as self-directed or not   may be less important than understanding the concept of shared context in motion'.  (See Section 2.3.)

2. Meta-learning as a font of knowledge.  We all have a lot to learn about learning.

3. Peers are equals, but different.  The learner mustn't seek only to concern what they already know, and must therefor confront and make sense of difference as part of the learning experience.

4. Learning is distributed and nonlinear.  Side-tracking is OK, but dissipation isn't likely to work. Part of paragogy is learning how to  find one's way around a given social  eld.

5. Realize the dream, then wake up!  Paragogy is the art of fullling motivations when this is possible, and then going on to the next thing.

## New Culture of learning
- the culture emerges from the environment—and grows along with it
- learning through engagement within the world
- In a world of near-constant flux,play becomes a strategy for embracing change, rather than a way
for growing out of it
- The world is changing faster than ever and our skill sets have a shorter life
- Understanding play is critical to understanding learning
- The world is getting more connected that ever before – can that be a resource?
- In this connected world, mentorship takes on new importance and meaning
- Challenges we face are multi-faceted requiring systems thinking & socio-technical sensibilities
- Skills are important but so are mind sets and dispositions
- Innovation is more important than ever – but turns on our ability to cultivate imagination
- A new culture of learning needs to leverage social & technical infrastructures in new ways
- Play is the basis for cultivating imagination and innovation


## Constructivist Paradigm
Constructivism describes a range of teaching/learning approaches which have at their centre two main principles:

1. Learning is a process rather than an event, in which learners construct (versus acquire) new knowledge and skills;
2. Teaching involves supporting that construction, as opposed to didactic,lecture-based imparting of information or knowledge

> The educational situation which most effectively promotes significant learning is one in which (1) threat to the self of the learner is reduced a minimum, and (2) differentiated perception of the field of experience is facilitated. ~Godfrey Barrett-Lennard

## Principles of connectivism:

- Learning and knowledge rests in diversity of opinions.
- Learning is a process of connecting specialized nodes or information sources.
- Learning may reside in non-human appliances.
- Capacity to know more is more critical than what is currently known
- Nurturing and maintaining connections is needed to facilitate continual learning.
- Ability to see connections between fields, ideas, and concepts is a core skill.
- Currency (accurate, up-to-date knowledge) is the intent of all connectivist learning activities.
- Decision-making is itself a learning process. Choosing what to learn and the meaning of incoming information is seen through the lens of a shifting reality. While there is a right answer now, it may be wrong tomorrow due to alterations in the information climate affecting the decision.

## Lists of Design Principles for Communities
### Axelrod's (1984) requirements for the possibility of cooperation:
- Arrange that individuals will meet each other again
- They must be able to recognize each other
- They must have information about how the other has behaved until now (reputation)

### Ostrom's (1990) design principles of successful communities:
- Group boundaries are clearly defined
- Rules governing the use of collective goods are well matched to local needs and conditions
- Most individuals affected by these rules can participate in modifying the rules
- The right of community members to devise their own rules is respected by external authorities
- A system for monitoring members' behavior exists; this monitoring is undertaken by the community members themselves
- A graduated system of sanctions is used
- Community members have access to low-cost conflict resolution mechanisms

### Godwin's (1994) principles for making virtual communities work:
- Use software that promotes good discussion
- Don't impose a length limitation on postings
- Front-load your system with talkative, diverse people
- Let the users resolve their own disputes
- Provide institutional memory
- Promote continuity
- Confront the users with a crisis

## Heutagogy foundations

- Flexible and negotiated assessment
- Having the learner generate contextually relevant content
- True collaboration regarding content and process between teacher and learner
- The involvement of the environment in the learning
- Spontaneous and organic learning experiences
- Flexible curricula



## 7 PRINCIPLES OF LEARNING – THE SHORT VERSION
Seven principles of learning, the foundation of a Principles-of-Learning Framework (Weibell, 2011),

Principle 1 – Potential. Humans are endowed with an inherent potential for increase in capacity, the establishment of habit, and the definition of being.

Principle 2 – Target. Human potential may be channeled intentionally toward a specific, predetermined target of learning, or will otherwise follow incidentally from the conditions to which a person is subjected.

Principle 3 – Change. Learning is a specific type of change, which is governed by principles of (a) repetition, (b) time, (c) step size, (d) sequence, (e) contrast, (f) significance, and (g) feedback.

Principle 4 – Practice. Principles of change are activated and aligned with learning targets through models of practice, exercise, or experience.

Principle 5 – Context. Learning is facilitated by a context of practice that is the same as, or accurately represents, the context of performance.

Principle 6 – Engagement. Learners will often engage in certain activities as a matter of habit, though they are also influenced by their current capacity to engage, as well as factors of motivation and inhibition related to the activity as a whole, part of the activity, its circumstances, or its expected results.

Principle 7 – Agency. Learners are not passive recipients of learning, but active agents with the ability to choose how they will apply their attention and effort, and to choose what learning activities they will engage in. Others may exercise their agency to promote or inhibit the agency of the learner, and may play a role in facilitating or impeding successful learning.

## Principles of distributed learning communities

- Distributed control
- Commitment to the generation and sharing of new knowledge
- Flexible and negotiated learning activities
- Autonomous community members
- High levels of dialogue, interaction and collaboration
- A shared goal, problem or project that brings a common focus and incentive to work together
