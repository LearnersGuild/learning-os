# Didn't make the cut / Still digesting / Second class citizens

## Separate support and evaluation

## Individual and collective tensions
There is a significant and difficult to measure value that comes from human connection and belonging.

  - Dignity is derived from human connection & belonging
  - Collaboration over individual excellence
  - Pods are the primary learning unit
  - Use and hold the tension between the individual and the collective. resist the urge to choose one side or another.
  - Minimize self-sacrifice required for collective learning
  - Don't sacrifice the community to honor individuality
  - "I can succeed without you. Your success and mine are related and connected."
  - "I could learn without you. I learn better with you."
  - Value/valorize human connection

## LG and the "real world" work environment
  - Tension between our learning community and their work environment
  - Dignified learning produces a growth in trust, agency, and wisdom.
  - Tie the reality of their behavior to their outcomes.
  - Resist the temptation to make the learning environment shit because the work will be shit and we want to prepare people for shit
  - Prepare people for the forces that will work against them in the work environment
  - Don’t try and change the world to fit our learners
  - I can’t prepare the future for my kids, but I can prepare the kids for the future
  - Rift between individuals dignity and the professional worlds ability to recognize that dignity. The learners need to be able to teach the professional world to acknowledge and honor their dignity.

## Focus on the meta, process over product
- We are more concerned about meta learning and learning than about product and production because our faith is that when people focus on the learning the product will take care of itself
- Invest in meta-learning and non tech skills

## Misc
  - Low stakes learning about high stakes issues
  - Minimize the cost of switching crafts
  - Ecosystem not factory
  - Failure is positive and supported.
  - scale through human relationships
  - Facilitation over Instruction
  - Intentional and selective about what stress we put the learners under
  - Separation of knife and feedback. Player support and assessment are separated. If there’s something that’s going to impact my ability to stay at learners guild it should be separated. (jeffrey thinks this is impossible). Build a firewall or some insulation from the learning environment from the reality that at any moment you could be kicked out
  - Daniel needs to not be dependant on Mr. Miagi.
  - High expectation high support
  - Balance competition and collaboration
  - Encourage and prioritize conceptual understanding
  - Support Collaborative Knowledge Construction

## Theoretical accuracy over implementation precision

Learners’ proximity to the essential concept is more valuable than proximity to established notions of praxis. If the concept is accurately understood, the embodiment of that concept is of little concern.

Example: we measure learners’ ability to create an object-oriented design, not the language or language features they use to build it.

## Eat your own dog food.

We manage our business culture like we manage our learning culture: embodying in our own practices what we expect from our learners and partners.

The cultural architecture we develop and implement internally for ourselves will serve as the foundation for the learning culture that we offer to our members.

## Imagination trumps knowledge

Programming is not about what you know, it's about what you can figure out.

## Data is not always first

Design decisions are not primarily data driven.

Design is both art and science. Of course we will use as much data as we can get our hands on. But the design will also be informed by:

- Our past individual and collective experience
- Other people's experience and feedback (educators, facilitators, learners, friends.....etc.)
- Our intuition, feelings and best guesses based on thought experiments
- Our sense of aesthetics
- Our guiding principles, beliefs, and world views
- Existing bodies of research (and our biased interpretation of them)
- Deliberately designed feedback loops (both qualitative and quantitative)

So, if you have a very very loose definition of "data" then yes. Otherwise, we are most certainly not primarily data driven.

## Beliefs
  - Learning is a process of integrating and adapting new information into existing knowledge.


## Agile Learning Centers Principles

### Infinite Play: Play infinitely, grow infinitely..

Play is one of the most powerful paths to growth. The concept of infinite play reminds us that games aren’t about winning; changing rules and boundaries is part of playing, letting players constantly expand the game of outrageous personal growth to incorporate new players and new frontiers.

### Be Agile:

Make tools and practices flexible, adaptable, easy to change… or change back again. Too much change all at once can be disorienting -- try gentle changes over multiple iterations to see what’s working.

### Amplify Agency

Ensure tools support personal choice and freedom as well as responsibility for those choices. Everyone should have the opportunity to participate in designing and upgrading the structures which guide them.

### Culture Creation
Acknowledge and use the water you’re swimming in. We shape culture; culture shapes us. A powerful, positive culture is the strongest, most pervasive support structure a learning community can have.  Develop collective mastery rather than restrictive rule-making. Intentional culture building supports intentionality in other domains as well.

### Visible Feedback
Make choices, patterns, and outcomes visible to participants so they can tune their future behavior accordingly. Make the implicit explicit and expand transparency. These practices empower and build trust among community members.

### Facilitate

Clarify, simplify, and connect. Don’t introduce unnecessary complexity. Hold coherence for personal growth in an empowered cultural context. Connect kids to the larger social capital of their community as they seek learning resources. Combine many principles and intentions into a single tool or practice, instead of trying to maintain more of them.

### Support
Provide maximum support with minimal interference. As adults, we often need support reaching our goals and fulfilling our intentions; so do children. We create supportive structures, practices, culture, and environments. However it’s important to remember that support is not direction -- it does not mean making their decisions for them or intervening and managing their processes. Support that takes up too much space becomes counterproductive.

### Respect each other’s time and space
Hold no unnecessary meetings. Keep all meetings tight, productive and participatory. Honor commitments, as well as scheduled start and end times for happenings. Check-in before creating work for someone else. Be thoughtful about taking up shared space.

### Relationship
Be real. Be accepting. Respect differences. Authentic relationship is the basis of partnership, communication, collaboration, and trust between students and staff. Support self-expression, self-knowledge and self-acceptance, letting the experience of nurturing relationship teach the power of interrelatedness and community.

### Full-spectrum Fluency
Embrace multiple intelligences, modes of expression, and learning styles. Nurture multiple literacies. A functional education for today’s world needs to focus on more than just “book-learning” textual, numerical, analytical, or memorization skills. Social, relational, digital, and a variety of other skill sets are now essential; recognize and develop them as such.

### Shareable Value
Make value received from learning visible and sharable. Use tracking systems, record measurable progress, generate documentation (blogs, portfolios, images), and teach others.

### Safe Space-making
Provide an environment of physical, social, and emotional safety. Set and keep critical boundaries. Foster great freedom within an appropriate frame of safety and legality, so that kids’ energy can be freed up to focus on learning instead of protecting themselves.

## Life Long learning

- Learning should take place in the context of authentic, complex problems (because
learners will refuse to quietly listen to someone else’s answers to someone else’s
questions) [Bruner, 1996].
- Learning should be embedded in the pursuit of intrinsically rewarding activities
[Csikszentmihalyi, 1990].
- Informal learning activities are equally important in lifelong learning and in formal
learning activities [Bransford, 2005].
- Learning often takes place without teaching [Illich, 1971; Wenger, 1998].
- Learning-on-demand needs to be supported because change is inevitable, complete
coverage is impossible, and obsolescence is unavoidable [Fischer, 1991].
- Organizational and collaborative learning must be supported because the individual
human mind is limited [Arias et al., 2000].
- Skills and processes that support learning as a lifetime habit must be developed
[Gardner, 1991].
- Lifelong learning is more than training and more than school learning [Fischer, 2000]
