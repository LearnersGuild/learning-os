# LOS Blueprint

The blueprint for our Learning Operating System (LOS).

This folder serves as both a guide to our design and development process.

The design guide addresses questions such as:

- Which beliefs, philosophies, principles, concepts, strategies, and elements make up our learning design?
- How do we design learning? What is our learning design process?
- Why do we use the language and processes we use?
- Who are our players? What are their characteristics and objectives?
