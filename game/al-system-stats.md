# Player Stats - Systemic Quadrant

The Systemic quadrant describes stats that relate to a Player's observations and interactions with systems like Learners Guild, the LG Game, the software development industry, organizations, politics, economies, countries, job markets, etc. Player Stats classified in the systemic quadrant must describe a Player's behaviors, abilities, or performance qualities as they relate to systems that are inherently more complex (and more abstract) than the personal or inter-personal quadrants. 

## System Quadrant Stat Groups
* Identifying systemic forces and constraints
* Solving systemic problems
* Designing new systems
* Building new systems

## Quality Stats 

Each of the following Quality Stats have an adjective describing the quality to be assessed and a generalized rubric for assessing that specific quality.

### Systemic Qualities

#### Considerate (Thoughtful)
0 - No obvious thought demonstrated in this person’s work or presenting behavior
25 - Some thought demonstrated though largely inconsistent
50 - Some consistent thought demonstrated, but not enough
75 - Consistent and satisfactory thought demonstrated in this person’s work and presenting behavior
100 - Evidence of deeply insightful thinking combining multiple considerations and levels of abstraction

#### Relevant (Meaningful)
0 - The person’s output (work or presenting behavior) is totally irrelevant to their practice, their POD, and their industry
25 - This output is somewhat relevant to a single category (practice, POD, industry)
50 - This output is relevant to multiple people or groups
75 - This output is both relevant and timely to everyone who interacts with it
100 - This is what everyone needed before they knew they needed it.

#### Actionable
0 - This output is not actionable. No one can apply it to their own practice or use it to further their own work.
25 - This output seems useful but it’s confusing how to apply it or take advantage of it.
50 - Somewhat actionable. This person took steps to inform others how they could use this output in their own projects or toward their own goals.
75 - This output is very actionable and can easily be incorporated into other people’s efforts. 
100 - This output is so easy to act on that it feels effortless to instantly incorporate it into my own practice.

#### Economic
0 - Way more effort went into this than the value of the output warranted
25 - Some attention was paid to achieving equal work input to value output, but it missed.
50 - Cost neutral. Effort in = value out
75 - This output is way more valuable than the effort that went into producing it.
100 - This output defies the laws of physics. Apparently you CAN actually create matter and energy out of thin air.

#### Sustainable
0 - This output is totally unsustainable and will vanish as soon as it is offered.
25 - Continuing to use or apply this output will cost more resources than are currently available. 
50 - It would be taxing but we could continuously sustain using and applying this output.
75 - This output is relatively easy to maintain. It also contributes to the sustainability of other people’s output.
100 - This output represents a significant infrastructural improvement to our organization and possibly even the industry. I’m not sure how we survived without it.

#### Innovative
0 - This output is completely contrived and derivative. There’s almost no new value here.
25 - There’s some new value here, but it’s hard to access or seems very similar to other, better alternatives.
50 - This output is definitely novel, but it’s usefulness as a novelty is questionable.
75 - This novel output advances the very practice it sprouted from. 
100 - This is so innovative, the industry will never be the same once it gets a hold of this. 

#### Viral
0 - No one is going to talk about this output
25 - A few people will tweet this or share it with a friend if they are within shouting distance.
50 - Upon exposure to this output, people will be more likely than not to share it with appropriate colleagues/friends.
75 - This is going to go viral in the community of software devs. Get ready to be on the first page of Hacker News
100 - This is the next Gangnam Style

## Health Stats

### Systemic Values

#### Purpose
* I maintain a definition of my purpose
* I continuously seek to define and refine my purpose for being a software developer
* I show commitment to my Purpose
* I regularly reflect on how my behavior is in alignment with my purpose and how it is not. 
* When I identify misalignments, I make an effort to fix them.
* I investigate work that’s requested of me to determine if it is a manifestation of my purpose.
* I start work only when it fits within my purpose
* I avoid working with people who push me off my purpose
* I seek out people, communities, and job opportunities that strongly align with my purpose.

* I consider the goals/needs of myself, my team, my company, and my community whenever making big decisions
* I observe human and computer interactions and simulate and predict the results. 
* I analyze my predictions against observed results and reflect on them in an effort to improve my future simulations
* I simulate my own interactions to predict how they will dynamically change the system of people and machines into which I apply them.
* I consciously and deliberately consider predicted results and outcomes before interacting with a system.

### Nuance
* I look for complex details in what appears to be simple
* I simplify things that are overly complex
* I notice details and reflect on them
* I seek to understand new information on multiple levels of abstraction
* I “read” each situation I find myself in.

### Impact
* I maintain an inventory of the software development industry’s needs.
* I address these needs in my work as a software developer

* I blog and read other people’s blogs
* I follow open source, and other major projects/initiatives that have global impact.
* Before submitting code, I ask myself if it will benefit the world or harm it.
* I actively decide how I want to contribute to the world.
