# Game Mechanics

## Skills

Skills are the high-level learning outcomes of our Applied Game.

They are similar to a professional skill or field of the kind that would appear on a job description or the learning outcomes as listed on a course syllabus.

Each skill has one or more levels which learners advance through. Generally, skill levels have a one-to-one correlation with a domain on the Skills Map. Learners who complete all of the required nodes in a domain gain the skill level.

Examples: "Skill: Web Developer; Levels: Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner, Expert", "Skill: Learning Mentor; Levels: Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner"

## Skill Points

Skill points, or SP for short, are numeric values representing advancement towards a particular skill. They are akin to XP (experience points) in game design.

**The primary motivator for learners is to accumulate SP.** These are the primary signifiers of learning in our Applied Game, and as such, they should be _accurate_ and _precise_ indicators.

Skill points are gained by completing tasks (as defined on the Skills Map) and are associated with specific _objectives_.

## Objectives

Objectives are higher-resolution learning outcomes that have a particular SP value. They are also associated with one or more exercise and/or project.

**To complete an exercise or project is to achieve the objectives associated with that exercise or project, and the result is SP.**

Objectives can be described as one of three types: knowledge, behavior, and beliefs.

##### Knowledge

Knowledge units constitute what people know when they are done with the program.

Example: "I know that HTML is used for creating the DOM, while JavaScript is used to manipulate it"

##### Habits

A habit or behavioral response defines how learners behave in a specific scenario.

Example: "When I'm pair programming with someone, I speak openly and freely as things come to my mind."

##### Beliefs

Operating beliefs are what people believe about themselves, the craft, other people, and the world.

Example: "As a software developer, I believe I can tackle any problem I'm faced with; I may not come up with a solution, but I will definitely come up with a better definition of the problem."
