# Documentation

Documentation for the Learning Operating System (LOS).

The LOS is comprised of five components:

1. [Roles](roles.md)
2. [Contracts](contracts.md)
3. [Processes](processes.md)
4. [Statistics](statistics.md)
5. [Game Objects](game-objects.md)

Together these form the structure of the LOS and allow for our learning environment to flourish according to the design principles defined in our [blueprint](../blueprint/design-principles.md).

The lifecycle of the game follows defined stages and a rhythm, as articulated in the section [Rhythm & Stages](#rhythm-&-stages) below.

## Overview

Every person who interacts with the LOS takes on one or more **roles**.

Every role has a purpose, and they express their purpose by working on **contracts**.

These roles interact with the system by creating, committing to, engaging, and completing contracts. Contracts have clear goals and terms by which those goals may or may not be reached.

One or more roles may work with any given contract. The contracts ultimately determine how roles relate to themselves and to each other.

In order to work with contracts, there are several defined **processes**. At minimum, these processes will allow roles to interact with contracts at each stage of the _contract lifecycle_:

1. _Define_: generate a new contract
1. _Commit_: decide to accept the terms of a contract
1. _Engage_: work on a contract
1. _Close_: complete or abandon a contract

In addition, there are processes for roles to _assess_, _amend_, and _review_ a contract. These processes are not a part of the lifecycle, but are available for roles to use when necessary and appropriate.

The system also tracks **statistics** about many of the activities happening within. For example, there could be statistics that track the abilities a Learner role has achieved through their work completing contracts (Skill Stat). Similarly, there could be statistics about how many contracts a Mentor role has completed (Mentorship Stat).

Finally, **game objects** are persistent artifacts used by players that span multiple processes and contracts.

## Rhythm & Stages

### Rhythm with Cycles

The primary unit of time by which progress is measured in the game is the **cycle**..

Cycles are like games in tennis: they do not necessarily correspond to a set amount of clock time, but they have a clear start, middle, and end.

Cycles are used to chunk up work, and provide the core rhythm of the game. They allow players to ground their statistics in some tangible sense of progress.

Stats are measured in terms of metric per cycle. Examples of how cycles _could_ be used to show progress:

- Feedback given, received, integrated per cycle
- RSGs achieved and failed per cycle
- Relative Contribution Delta per cycle

### Advancement with Stages

Stages are sections through which players advance towards victory.

Stage transitions include a rite of passage, conferring greater responsibility and privileges to the player.

Each stage corresponds to a separate role in the game. New players start at the lowest stage/role, and advance to higher stages by earning more powerful roles.

There are a total of 6 stages to the game (starting at 0), each corresponding to a different role:

1. **Stage 0: Aspirant**
1. **Stage 1: Apprentice**
1. **Stage 2: Mentor**
1. **Stage 3: Agent**
1. **Stage 4: Creator**
1. **Stage 5: Practitioner**

Like cycles, stages are not time-bound. They serve as opportunities to recognize and celebrate significant transformation events in a player's advancement.
