### Working with Contracts

The contract is the core object in the LOS. It is a highly versatile and powerful tool for defining goals and protocols for relationships between roles.

At their essence, contracts are an agreement between two parties. In some cases, those two parties are the same person, in other cases they are one or more separate people.

A contract is an agreement that specifies clear objectives, the required commitments of each party involved, a protocol for engagement, a way to assess, and terms by which the contract is voided.

Contracts use explicit, actionable language to avoid ambiguity. They assume respect, require individual integrity, and build mutual trust.

Contracts control how a player takes on a role.

Of the many things that contracts can do within the LOS, here are a few:

- Allow a player to commit to a role
- Define a learning task
- Propose a challenge
- Offer and provide support


## Contract Attributes

There are multiple types of contracts. All contracts share the same attributes, but will have different values for each.

Every contract contains (at minimum) the following attributes:

- Name
- Purpose
- Values
- Terms
  - Commitments
  - Success criteria
- Assessment method
- Statistics
