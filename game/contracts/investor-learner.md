# Investor Learner Contract

## Purpose

The purpose of the Investor-Learner contract is to codify the relationship between investor(s) and learner(s). Without an Investor-Learner contract in place, a Learner may not enter the game.

## Values

<!-- TODO: figure out values -->

## Terms

The Investor-Learner contract may exist in any of 6 different stages:

1. Engagement
  - During _engagement_ the investor loans the Learner up to $1,500 a month
  - Engagement state has a flexible duration
  - If a Learner wants to continue to receive $1,500 in stipend past 40 weeks, they need to pass a _reassessment_.
  - If they don't pass _reassessment_ they may still continue to play the game but the investor will no longer be giving them a loan.

2. Job Hunt
  - A contract moves to job hunt when a Learner leaves the game
  - During Job Hunt the investor stops loaning the Learner

3. Employed
  - A contract moves to _employed_ once a Learner gets a full time job using their craft

4. Dignified Livelihood
  - A contract moves to _dignified livelihood_ once a Learner gets a full time job using their craft, with an annual salary of $50,000 or more.
  - During _dignified livelihood_ the learner starts paying back their stipend and tuition (see "Commitments" below).
  - Payback is 3 years at up to 20% of salary (depending on how much stipend the Learner takes)

5. Closed - Success
  - 3 years of payments have been made and contract is closed

6. Closed - Fail
  - Over 12 months pass from the end of _engagement period_ and learner was not able to gain  _dignified livelihood_ despite their best and sincere effort
  - Investor forgives all learner debt

## Commitments

- Learner commits to the _engagement period_ until either:
  - a minimum of 40 weeks have passed, or
  - until a full-time employment position applying their craft is accepted.
- During the _engagement period_, a Learner must commit to being on-site, playing the game for a minimum of 45 hours per week.
- Learner commits to repaying the money borrowed, plus interest, once the contract is in  _dignified livelihood_.

## Success criteria

To successfully complete and _close_ the contract, a Learner must attain a full-time employment position applying their craft and fully repay their debt.

## Re-assessment method

The assessment that happens during the 40 week _reassessment_ will be an objective evaluation. Any in-game statistic that is more than two standard deviations worse than the mean for that statistic (computed on an ongoing basis for all Learners to ever reach 40 weeks in the _engagement period_).

## Statistics
