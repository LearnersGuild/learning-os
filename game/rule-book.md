## Story

### Premise

You are here to create a dignified livelihood.
There are many paths to a dignified livelihood.
This game sets up many experiences to facilitate you discovering your path.
The path is an expression of dignified livelihood.

It is a path of play, the empowerment of self teaching, of creating meaning and learning with others, of bringing other people forward with you.
This a journey, you get there by earning your way there.
You will be supported, asked to support others, and you will be challenged.

### Theme

> TODO: What is the theme of the game?

## Objectives

The objective of the game is to secure a livelihood with dignity and continuous learning for my both my pod and myself, in an organization where people are excited to work with me.

## Players

### Roles

#### Aspirant
An Aspirant is an individual who has expressed interest in joining Learners Guild, but has not yet become part of a Pod. She has not yet been vetted by existing Players (v0: LG Partners) as meeting the baseline criteria required to become a Player.

#### Learner
A Learner is an individual playing the game. She will follow her own path through the terrain in the game and will advance from level to level as she does so. She will initially be a member of a single Pod, but (as she advances in the game) will also become part of other Pods in her capacity as a Mentor (see below).

#### Mentor
Players who have been playing the game for long enough will also be Mentors. Mentors are responsible for helping other Players in the game who are playing at lower levels. It will not be possible to win the game without Mentoring other Players as they move through the terrain of the game.

### Requirements

### Player Name
Every player has a name that identifies her in group chat rooms and scoreboards. This name may be derived from a player's "given" name, or may be a non-legally-binding "chosen" name. It should, however, be a name that the player is excited about, as other players will use it to address her and interact with her. It must be a single word (i.e., no spaces) and should be comprised of standard alpha-numeric characters and a subset of punctuation symbols: ('.', '-', '\_').

## Player Stats

There are three types of Player Stats: Skill, Value and Health

### Skill Stats

Players have many different skills that they are developing throughout the game. Each skill has one or more levels which players advance through. Players start each skill at level 0.

Each skill is broken down into stats: experience and abilities. Players level up by acquiring experience and abilities related to that skill. As a player develops a skill past a certain point, they "level up" to a new Skill Level.

#### Experience

As a player navigates the game terrain, they gain Experience Points (XP) related to specific skills. For example, after a player builds an online profile they might gain 50 XP for the CSS skill, and 40 XP for their HTML skill. XP points are meant to track the level of practice a certain player has had using and developing a certain skill. Each skill level has an XP threshold. Once a player crosses that threshold, they have enough XP to attempt to level up. Each consecutive level has a higher XP threshold for any particular skill.

#### Abilities

While XP tracks *how much* a player has practiced a certain skill, Abilities track the capacities, knowledge, and beliefs the player has acquired in their practice. Each skill level has a predetermined Ability Set that a player needs to acquire before they can attempt to level up.

To continue with the above example, the "Build online profile" challenge might have 50 CSS XP, and 40 HTML XP, and the following abilities:
* I can use html rows and columns to display a table
* I can extract css variables into a separate file

Once a player completes this challenge these abilities will show up respectively under their HTML Skill Stat, and their CSS Skill stat.

#### Leveling Up

In order for a player to achieve a higher level for a skill, they need to complete a Level Up Challenge. Before they are allowed to attempt the Level Up Challenge they need to have accumulated enough XP for that skill to cross the XP Threshold, and they need to have acquired all of the abilities in that Skill's Ability Set.

Once the Level Up Challenge is successfully completed, the player moves to the next level for that skill, and the XP and abilities are reset to 0.

### Value Stats

Value Stats reflect the degree to which the player demonstrates certain values *through their behavior*. If Skill Stats are a measure of *where* the player has travelled, and *what* they have acquired along the way in terms of experience and abilities, Value Stats reflect *how* the player is traveling and traversing the game terrain.

Value Stats are always expressed through a collection observable and verifiable behaviors (Behavior Set).

For example, an Integrity Value Stat might be composed of the following Behavior Set.
* I keep my word
* I show up on time
* When I'm out of integrity, I quickly name it

Unlike Skill Stats, there are no levels, or leveling up when it comes to Value Stats. Instead Values are represented using a single 1 to 5 score. 5 being the highest demonstration of the value, and 1 being the lowest. Each behavior within a value's behavior set is also scored from 1 to 5.

Value Stats changed based on self, peer, and mentor assessment. They have a "decay factor", so the older an assessment is, the less weight it has on the overall Value score. This gives player's a chance to recover their score from poor behavior and removes the "permanent record" feel of the Value Stat.

### Health Stats


### Stat Sheet
The stat sheet reflects the player's skill levels, their demonstration of values, and their health.
Every player has a stat sheet that is visible to them that tracks their progress and success in the game.

### Gradual Reveal

Players start tracking a new skill when they encounter a challenge that exposes them to it. They start off with a few skills that are being tracked and as the game develops the list grows.

### Player Level & Player Values
The highest and most important stat is the player level. This is the sum total of all that players'

## Game Objects

### Skills

Skills are the high-level learning outcomes of our Applied Game.

They are similar to a professional skill or field of the kind that would appear on a job description or the learning outcomes as listed on a course syllabus.

 Generally, skill levels have a one-to-one correlation with a domain on the Skills Map. Learners who complete all of the required nodes in a domain gain the skill level.

Examples: "Skill: Web Developer; Levels: Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner, Expert", "Skill: Learning Mentor; Levels: Novice, Apprentice, Practitioner"

### Skill Points

Skill points, or SP for short, are numeric values representing advancement towards a particular skill. They are akin to XP (experience points) in game design.

**The primary motivator for learners is to accumulate SP.** These are the primary signifiers of learning in our Applied Game, and as such, they should be _accurate_ and _precise_ indicators.

Skill points are gained by completing tasks (as defined on the Skills Map) and are associated with specific _objectives_.

### Levels

### Missions

Missions are defined tasks with learning outcomes that, when completed, advance a learner's (or pod's) skills. Learners complete missions to earn SP.

#### Mission Objectives

Mission objectives are higher-resolution learning outcomes that have a particular SP value. They are associated with one mission.

**To complete a mission is to achieve its objectives, and SP is earned for each objective.**

Objectives can be described as one of three types: knowledge, behavior, and beliefs.

##### Knowledge

Knowledge units constitute what people know when they are done with the program.

Example: "I know that HTML is used for creating the DOM, while JavaScript is used to manipulate it"

##### Habits

A habit or behavioral response defines how learners behave in a specific scenario.

Example: "When I'm pair programming with someone, I speak openly and freely as things come to my mind."

##### Beliefs

Operating beliefs are what people believe about themselves, the craft, other people, and the world.

Example: "As a software developer, I believe I can tackle any problem I'm faced with; I may not come up with a solution, but I will definitely come up with a better definition of the problem."

## Resources

See player support resources. <!-- TODO: needs link. -->

## Boundaries
- Time limit: 40 weeks
- Pod size: 10 to 12
- Technical curriculum is relevant to web development
- Social-Emotional Literacy curriculum is relevant to web development

## Timing
The game is ongoing and is played in "real time". Players will join the game in Pods, with all Players in a Pod starting at the same time. Not all Pods start at the same time; new Pods start the game every 5 weeks. Each Pod spends 40 weeks playing the game. No Aspirant can play the game before applying and being accepted to a Pod.

## Advancement

Challenge in the game is worth 0 or more skill-points (SPs) across 4 different skill-areas:

- **Personal**: meta-cognitive skills (learning how to learn), self-awareness, self-assessment, etc.
- **Social**: teamwork, giving and receiving feedback, vulnerability, etc.
- **Technical**: "hard" skills related to the profession of web development
- **Systemic**: capacity to understand, critique, and influence change in larger systems

SPs contribute directly to how a player advances through Levels in the game. In order to move from lower Levels to higher Levels, a Player must achieve a minimum number of SPs in each of the 4 areas. Lower Levels may not require SPs across all 4 skill-areas, but more advanced levels will require a minimum number of SPs across each area. This incentivizes players to develop a well-rounded set of skills without excelling in one skill-area at the expense of the others. SPs are acquired by completing challenges.

_For example_, an implementation of Levels may look as follows:

| Level | Personal  | Social    | Technical  | Systemic |
|:------|:----------|:----------|:-----------|:---------|
| 1     | 100       | 0         | 100        | 0        |
| 2     | 200       | 100       | 100        | 0        |
| 3     | 400       | 150       | 200        | 100      |
| ...   | ...       | ...       | ...        | ...      |
| 18    | 250,000   | 250,000   | 2,500,000  | 25,000   |
| 19    | 500,000   | 500,000   | 5,000,000  | 50,000   |
| 20    | 1,000,000 | 1,000,000 | 10,000,000 | 100,000  |

### Challenges

Many challenges can be completed individually, while others must be completed as part of a pair, as a 4-Player group, as an entire Pod, or as multiple Pods. Different challenges yield different types of game-play. All challenges have a time limit, though time limits will vary depending on the complexity of the challenge.

_For example_, here are some challenge structures:

| \# of Players | \# of Pods | Time Limit | Play Type                |
|:--------------|:-----------|:-----------|:-------------------------|
| 1             | 0          | 2 hours    | Player vs. Game          |
| 2             | 0          | 4 hours    | Pair vs. Game            |
| 2             | 0          | 2 hours    | Player vs. Player        |
| 4             | 0          | 2 days     | Project Team vs. Game    |
| 4             | 0          | 1 day      | Pair vs. Pair            |
| 12            | 1          | 3 days     | Project Team competition |
| 12            | 1          | 1 week     | Pod vs. Game             |
| 24            | 2          | 2 weeks    | Pod vs. Pod              |
| 48            | 4          | 5 weeks    | Pod competition          |

For challenges that require more than a single Player, there _may_ be a requirement that the Players have not worked together before.

## Victory Conditions

Skill Point accumulation and Health point accumulation allow you to take a Boss challenge and go up to a new level.

There is a floor where all members and the pod as a whole has to be at in order to try the boss challenge.

#### Admission Challenge Mechanism

**Mission: Technical Admission ( 1000 XP)**
Technical: "hard" skills related to the profession of web development

**Mission: Carbon Admission (1000 XP)**
Personal: meta-cognitive skills (learning how to learn), self-awareness, self-assessment, etc.
Social: teamwork, giving and receiving feedback, vulnerability, etc.
Systemic: capacity to understand, critique, and influence change in larger systems

#### Admittance to the Game
Every person seeking to join Learners Guild must complete a simple form, including:
- Name
- DOB
- [  ] I am able to participate full-time for 40 weeks
- [  ] I want a career as a professional software engineer
- Do you work full-time?
- If so, where?
- If not, how do you spend your waking hours?
- When can you start?

Once the form is completed, a person becomes an Aspirant on Level 0 of the game. Before becoming a full-fledged player in the game, Aspirants must prove their mettle by advancing to Level 1, which requires achieving point values of the following in each of the four skill-areas. For example: 100 (P) / 100 (So) / 100 (T) / 100 (Sy). Some Aspirants may have higher scores in an individual category, but no Aspirant may advance to Level 1 without meeting the minimum criteria in all four skill-areas.

Aspirants coming from partner organizations (e.g., "Black Girls Code") will be awarded immediate points in the social and systemic categories.

Aspirants acquire points by completing challenges where scores are assigned by players further advanced in the program. To ensure fairness, different Players will rate Aspirants on different challenges, with the more difficult challenges being scored by Players further advanced.

Challenges will include (but not be limited to):
- "grit" survey (v1+ -- include recorded video for certain parts of survey)
- face-to-face with multiple existing players at different levels
- multi-player challenges where giving and integrating feedback is part of the challenge (measure for "social" dimension: teamwork, vulnerability, group spirit, etc.)
- boss-level "final" admissions challenge (?)
