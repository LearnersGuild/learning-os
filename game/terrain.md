<!-- /TOC -->

The game terrain covers **40 weeks** of learning. It is organized into **8 phases** of 5 weeks each. These phases are grouped into **4 themes** of 2 phases each.

## External Boundaries: Start and Finish

The terrain starts after a pod finishes admissions and ends when the pod completes the game objective or when 40 weeks are up, whichever comes first.

### Game Start

For a pod to start the game, every member of the pod must have met the admissions criteria in each of the 4 quadrants.

Although these criteria are not currently a part of the game, the following is an example mission that demonstrates _roughly_ what level of technical skill is expected for a player/learner to have achieved before beginning the game.

#### Technical Pre-Start Mission

##### Mission: JS Tic-Tac-Toe

Build a tic-tac-toe game in JavaScript and publish as a GitHub pages site.

**Objectives:**
- I believe that JavaScript can be used to build a web app.
- I am able to program a complete and correct tic-tac-toe game.
- I can explain and identify variables, data types, collections, loops, conditionals, and functions.

## Internal Boundaries: Themes and Phases

Over the course of the program, learners experience an increase in personal and group autonomy. Inversely, they experience a decrease in structured content and clearly-defined tasks.

The themes are meant to serve as an articulation of this design. Learners and pods move from building and doing according to explicit expectations and rules towards a place where they set their own goals and direct their own group and individual learning.

### The Four Themes

1. **Build**: complete well-defined tasks according to established specifications (phase 1-2)
2. **Explore**: play, discover, and break things (phase 3-4)
3. **Analyze**: inquire, experiment, and seek understanding (phase 5-6)
4. **Create**: solve problems by ideation, designing, building, and testing (phase 7-8)

While each theme is meant to serve as an organizing and orienting principle for the phases it encompasses, they are not meant to be the _only_ kind of activity for those phases. Clearly, every phase will include aspects of building, exploring, analyzing, and creating.

The themes are better thought of as a macro-cycle of learning which is reproduced at multiple micro-levels. In this sense, the themes embody and express a _fractal design_.

### Progression through Themes

For each theme, there are different outcomes and primary activities for each of the four quadrants.

Listed in the table below are the main outcomes for each theme, split by quadrant:

|               | Build                                      | Explore                                                   | Analyze                                                         | Create                                                       |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Personal**  | Construct online/game identity             | Explore aspects of self, play with identity               | Develop mindfulness, identity analysis                          | Define and create new identity                               |
| **Social**    | Construct pod identity, define norms       | Rotate, play with group roles and dynamics                | Study group dynamics and collaboration patterns                 | Create group practices and identity                          |
| **Technical** | Build a full-stack web application         | Discover and play with other tools, languages, frameworks | Research and implement optimal ways to produce quality software | Ideate, build, deploy, and maintain a production-quality app |
| **Systemic**  | Adapt and build tools for systems thinking | Explore different systems and how they interact           | Inspect, reflect on, and critique different systems             | Engage systemic problems with creative agency                |
