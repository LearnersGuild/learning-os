What is the high level content of the NTC for the first 10 weeks? #49


Framing
A Learners Guild graduate is a life-long learner who is a self-aware, humble, confident, heartful, agile human in touch with their core values and goals, who can work effectively with others, and skilfully harness attention and intelligence for creativity and productivity .
 
Objective
Learn how to learn with a view to gainful employment and a dignified livelihood.

Structure
First two phases includes:
	- 1x 1 week of Orientation/Jam/Group building
	- 1x 4 week phase (3weeks plus Boss Challenge)
	- 1x 5 week phase (4 weeks plus Boss Challenge)
Each Phase ends with a week of Boss challenge.


Theme
The theme for the first two phases is 
	- Orientation and pod cohesion
	- Giving and receiving feedback.

Boss level changes can stand alone or be integrated with technical challenges.

5 Literacies
NTC is being ordered using the 5 literacies [make relevant to giving receiving feedback]
	○ Body - Relaxation practices (stress/trauma), and increasing sensory awareness (access to info + emotions) - Landing and realizing I have a body. 
	○ Mind - Focus, beginners mind, how do you learn?
	○ Emotions/Heart - emotional self awareness, appropriate response, kindness
	○ Social - Belonging, authentic listening, looping, group agreements, feedback
	○ System - Inquiry into systems that have impacted learners - school, family work


Phase 1

Orientation week [find a better name]

	- Deep level of welcoming people - who they are and what they bring
	- Slowing down as a practice
	- Drama triangle or Compass of reactions
	- Introduce concepts of inner, interpersonal, systemic
	- Kindness - Secret angels
	- Appreciative inquiry - skills building (authentic listening, looping, I statements, story sharing)
	- Exploration of the system questions - what is up in the room. 
	- Personal Envisioning - what are the capacities needed and what support do I want from my pod
	- Pod Envisioning - Common vision of what things are going to look like in 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 10 weeks, 40 weeks.
	- Support systems - what is available, and what do learners want 
	- Introduce feedback systems and metrics

After week one:
Learners have bonded as a pod, have basic communication skills, are clear on their vision, and are inspired about and primed for the game to begin/continue

Discussion point: How does the game start up in the first week? Is this a pregame game? Is it the start of the game, or at the end of the first week do people enter the game in a ceremony/fanfare?

Discussion point: First week in usual space, in another space?

Discussion point: The first week will be facilitated. We have the option of having more facilitator presence in the second week. Easing them into working together/alone in the game. 

Discussion point: How explicit is the ordering of the curriculum, or implicit?



Week 2
BODY:  focussed on stress and relaxation practices.
	• goal is to give people the capacity and tools to recognize stress patterns and move to regulation
	• Body scan, journalling, diads, group research and presentation. alternate sides.
	• Info on impact of stress on the body
	• Guided meditation - relaxation, irest, longer exhale than inhale
	• Teach two or three practices for regulating
	• Heart Rate Variability research example
	• down regulating amygdala etc
	• Physical practice encouragement/introduction + data on benefits
EMOTIONS: Introduction to self awareness cont… Irest frame, body sensations as information. Working with emotions - tie back into body and mind weeks. Incorporate opposites work from irest. 


Week 3
MIND: Attention training. Exploration of learning. How do you learn?
Touch back on envisioning. How is it going so far?


Week 4
SOCIAL - How does pod learning happen (following on from how to I learn)? Remind about authentic listening, diads.
SYSTEMS - How did a school teach me to relate to kindness and clarity


Week 5
BOSS LEVEL
Integration and synthesis
Where do we need people to be at the end of week five? In order to be a functional pod and to be able to move forwards.
Understanding by Design: Boss Challenge
	• What is the learner taking out into the world
	• What is the enduring understandings, ie slow down
	• Essential questions - What are you asking yourself all the time. ie how does this impact someones learning. How can this be scaled? 

Assessment happens straight after the boss test. What went wrong, what could be changed. 
Maybe week five facilitated group is review of the boss challenge. Iterative development.



Phase 2 

Week 6
BODY/EMOTIONS
Have talked about Stress, have done some work with awareness of the body.
More access to body leads to more information in self and world around, which is foundation of giving feedback. 
Self awareness as base.
Experiences of emotions are generally similar - Finish study 
What are your common emotions, how do they show up?


Week 7
MIND (More training)
Attention training. Noticing what is internal and externally happening.
Higher definition of what is happening
Beginners mind/curiosity
Could do some journaling - reflective. (Shows why going in can be helpful)


Week 8
SOCIAL (skills focus)
Review authentic listening
Looping practice - what I heard you say was.
Review the envisioning for the pod. Do we want to tweak anything? 
What are some positive qualities that you see emerging in your pod? (essential qualitites)


Week 9
SYSTEMS/Inquiry
What has my family taught me to relate to feedback, clarity and kindness.
How has my job history taught me to relate to feedback, clarity and kindness.
Inquiry - how did my family teach me to relate to myself - as a result, how do I relate to myself.
Same with school and job - friends/community.
What is the thread of how I have related to myself over time? Am I hard on myself? Am I worried about performance. Do I think less of myself than my actual capacity is? Am I kind with myself? 
4 basic human needs - to be seen, heard, connected and to belong.
Could use those 4 as questions for inquiry on each.
Later - if they don’t see me, then I don’t see me.
