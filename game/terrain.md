<!-- /TOC -->

The game terrain is composed of **missions** that help learners to build one or more **skills**.

The timeline of the program covers **40 weeks** of learning. It is organized into **8 phases** of 5 weeks each. These phases are grouped into **4 themes** of 2 phases each.

While individuals and pods will move through the terrain at different speeds, the timeline serves as useful guideposts and reference points for progress toward the game objective.

## External Boundaries: Start and Finish

The terrain starts after a pod finishes admissions and ends when the pod completes the final mission or when 40 weeks are up, whichever comes first.

### Game Start

For a pod to start the game, every member of the pod must have met the admissions criteria in each of the 4 quadrants.

Although these criteria are not currently a part of the game, the following is an example mission that demonstrates _roughly_ what level of technical skill is expected for a player/learner to have achieved before beginning the game.

#### Example Pre-Game Missions

##### Mission: JS Tic-Tac-Toe

Build a tic-tac-toe game in JavaScript and publish as a GitHub pages site.

Use the provided HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files as a template.

Submit the URL of the published website.

**Criteria:**
- Completed game is published as a website
- Game allows for two human players (X and O)
- Players mark a square by clicking on it
- After clicking on a square, game shifts to the other players turn
- When a tic-tac-toe has been achieved, game is over
- When a stalemate has been reached, game is over
- When game is over, game notifies which player is winner or if game is a stalemate

**Suggested Time:** 3-5 hours

**Skills:**
- Programming (150 SP - Technical)
	- Identify, explain, and apply variables in JavaScript code
	- Identify, explain, and apply data types in JavaScript code
	- Identify, explain, and apply collections in JavaScript code
	- Identify, explain, and apply loops in JavaScript code
	- Identify, explain, and apply conditional in JavaScript code
	- Identify, explain, and apply functions in JavaScript code
- Problem Solving (150 SP - Technical)
	- Translate game logic into program logic
	- Program a complete and correct tic-tac-toe game

**Rubric:**

_Assign a % score to each of the following._

- Completeness: submission game meets all criteria
- Quality: code is well-written, with no obvious bugs or errors
- Comprehension: learner can explain how and why they arrived at their solution

**Score:**

To obtain a score (i.e. SP earned for each skill), calculate the mean % of the above rubric and multiply by the total SP for each skill.

<!-- TODO: add pre-game mission(s) and objectives to address personal, social, and systems -->

### Game Finish

The final mission of the game is for every learner in the pod to secure employment as a software developer.

This mission will require the most time, effort, and perseverance. Other missions will build towards it, but this one represents the "ultimate boss level" of the applied game. To complete this mission is to win the game.

#### Final Mission: Acquire Dignified Employment

This mission is complete when every learner in the pod has secured a job as a software developer.

**Criteria:**
- Every member of your pod has a job where they are paid to build software.

**Suggested Time:** 6-10 weeks

**Skills:**
- Self-Awareness (2000 SP - Personal)
	- Select job opportunities based on own interest and abilities
	- Negotiate appropriate terms and compensation for job
- Career Literacy (10000 SP - Social)
	- Discover appropriate job openings
	- Prepare for a job interview
	- Navigate a hiring process
	- Get a job as a software developer
- Teamwork (2000 SP - Social)
	- Seek support and feedback in job application process from peers and mentors
	- Provide support and feedback to peers as they apply and interview for jobs
	- Share information and tips about applying and interviewing for jobs

**Rubric:**

_Assign a % score to each of the following._

- Completeness: everyone in the pod has a job
- Accuracy: everyone in the pod is a paid web developer

**Score:**

To obtain a score (i.e. SP earned for each skill), calculate the mean % of the above rubric and multiply by the total SP for each skill.

## Internal Boundaries: Skill Levels

For all of the skills learners are developing, they advance by unlocking/achieving **skill levels**.

### Progression through Skill Levels

To "level up" in a skill, learners and pods complete final missions (i.e. "boss levels").

These final missions start small and focused, and grow in both length and scope. Learners will complete many final missions per phase.

There are both final solo and a final pod mission, which must be completed individually and by the whole pod, respectively. Pod missions are team missions, with variance in team size (min 3, max 6).

Listed below are suggested progressions in the type and duration of final missions, along with their suggested durations:

| Final Solo Mission        | Final Pod Mission                                   |
|:--------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------|
| Online profile (2 days)   | Client-side app - 3 groups, defined specs (1 wk)    |
| Personal site (1 wk)      | Full-stack web app - 3 groups, defined specs (1 wk) |
| Passion project (1 wk)    | Web app - 3 groups, 3 options (1.5 wks)             |
| Passion project (2 wks)   | Web app - 2 groups, 6 options (2 wks)               |
| Deep dive project (1 wk)  | Full product - 3 groups, team choice (2.5 wks)      |
| Deep dive project (2 wks) | Full product - 2 groups, team choice (4 wks)        |
| Passion project (3 wks)   | Get a job (10 wks)                                  |

## Timeline: Themes and Phases

The 40 weeks of the program are broken down into 8 5-week phases, which are in turn grouped into 4 2-phase themes.

Over the course of the program, learners experience an increase in personal and group autonomy.

The themes are meant to serve as an articulation of this design. Learners and pods move from building and doing according to explicit expectations and rules towards a place where they set their own goals and direct their own group and individual learning.

### The Four Themes

1. **Build**: complete well-defined tasks according to established specifications (phase 1-2)
2. **Explore**: play, discover, and break things (phase 3-4)
3. **Analyze**: inquire, experiment, and seek understanding (phase 5-6)
4. **Create**: solve problems by ideation, designing, building, and testing (phase 7-8)

While each theme is meant to serve as an organizing and orienting principle for the phases it encompasses, they are not meant to be the _only_ kind of activity for those phases. Clearly, every phase will include aspects of building, exploring, analyzing, and creating.

The themes are better thought of as a macro-cycle of learning which is reproduced at multiple micro-levels. In this sense, the themes embody and express a _fractal design_.

### Progression through Themes

For each theme, there are different outcomes and primary activities for each of the four quadrants.

Listed in the table below are the general activities for each theme, split by quadrant:

|               | Build                                      | Explore                                                   | Analyze                                                         | Create                                                       |
|:--------------|:-------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------|:----------------------------------------------------------------|:-------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Personal**  | Construct online/game identity             | Explore aspects of self, play with identity               | Develop mindfulness, identity analysis                          | Define and create new identity                               |
| **Social**    | Construct pod identity, define norms       | Rotate, play with group roles and dynamics                | Study group dynamics and collaboration patterns                 | Create group practices and identity                          |
| **Technical** | Build a full-stack web application         | Discover and play with other tools, languages, frameworks | Research and implement optimal ways to produce quality software | Ideate, build, deploy, and maintain a production-quality app |
| **Systemic**  | Adapt and build tools for systems thinking | Explore different systems and how they interact           | Inspect, reflect on, and critique different systems             | Engage systemic problems with creative agency                |

### Progression through Phases

Phases are meant to serve as markers along the terrain, to be used by pods for gauging velocity and progress. Pods and learners may use them as part of their goal-setting, for example, "Reach level 7 in Front-End Dev by the end of Phase 3".

They are useful mostly as a way to provide a rhythm to the gameplay.

Other than that, they have no meaning. Phases do not have any direct, explicit impact on gameplay mechanics.
