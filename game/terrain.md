# Game Terrain

What is the highlevel content of the ntc for the first 10 weeks? #49

#Framing
The goal of the NTC for Phases 1 and 2 is to give learners and pods the abilities to function effectively in the game. The NTC is grounded, and is a response to, the emotional challenges brought up by the game mechanics, by learning, and the process of figuring out how to work together as a pod. 

 
#Phase Objectives:
Phase 1: building pod cohesion and the skills and capacities to operate within the game
Phase 2: building capacity to function optimally in the face of challenge, individually and collectively

#Structure
First two phases includes:
	1x 1 week of Initiation: Orientation/Jam/Group building
	1x 4 week phase (3 weeks plus Boss Challenge)
	1x 5 week phase (4 weeks plus Boss Challenge)
	Each Phase ends with a week of Boss challenge.
 
##Content Focus
	Orientation and pod cohesion
	Skills to function in the game
		**Communication**
		**Learning how to learn** (includes un-schooling)
		**Assessment**
		**Pod governance** (includes decision making, conflict resolution, facilitation)
		**Making challenges productive**
 
  
**Phase 1:**Building capacity to function optimally in the face of challenge, individually and collectively

Initiation week [find a better name/identity]
 
	Deep level of welcoming people - who they are and what they bring
	Slowing down as a practice, body grounding
	Drama triangle or Compass of reactions
	Introduce four quadrants (4Q)
	Kindness - Secret angels
	Appreciative inquiry - skills building (authentic listening, looping, I statements, story sharing)
	Conflict resolution framework
	Exploration of the system questions - what is up in the room - race/gender/class etc.
	Personal Envisioning - what are the capacities needed and what support do I want from my pod
	Pod Envisioning - Common vision of what things are going to look like in 2 weeks, 5 weeks, 10 weeks, 40 weeks.
	Support systems - what is available, and what do learners want
	Introduce feedback systems and metrics
 
**After week one:**
Learners have bonded as a pod, have basic communication skills, are clear on their vision, and are inspired about and primed for the game to begin/continue. They have experienced dignified community. 
 
Discussion point: How does the game start up in the first week? Is this a pregame game? Is it the start of the game, or at the end of the first week do people enter the game in a ceremony/fanfare?
 
Discussion point: First week in usual space, in another space?
 
Discussion point: The first week will be facilitated. We have the option of having more facilitator presence in the second week. Easing them into working together/alone in the game.
 
Discussion point: How explicit is the ordering of the curriculum, or implicit?



##Week 2

Do technical challenges - highlighting what NTC are required
