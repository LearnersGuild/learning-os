## Process: Cycle

The primary unit of time by which progress is measured in the game is the **cycle**..

Cycles are like games in tennis: they do not necessarily correspond to a set amount of clock time, but they have a clear start, middle, and end.

Cycles are used to chunk up work, and provide the core rhythm of the game. They allow players to ground their statistics in some tangible sense of progress.

Stats are measured in terms of metric per cycle. Examples of how cycles _could_ be used to show progress:

- Feedback given, received, integrated per cycle
- RSGs achieved and failed per cycle
- Relative Contribution Delta per cycle
