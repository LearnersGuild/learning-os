#Overview

I built this skill set by basing it on the skills learners will need to use to function in LG and then function in a professional evnironment. Because every pod is a start-up, there is a lot of overlap between those two.  

I have not defined levels. I see that as a game mechanic question. We should also define our feedback and assessment systems before we define levels. At this stage, I am just defining what all of the We skills are.

Each skill has a detailed list of abilities. There are a lot. Maybe too many. But, consider this -- these are the abilities learners need to have in order to function in LG successfully. Many of the skills are necessary from the first week. Running meetings, making decisions as a group, making learning plans, giving and receiving feedback -- all happen in the first week and they impact the pod's success. Many will have important impacts at the beginning. For example, if their meetings are disorganized all of the time, it impacts the pods' viability and their ability to learn. 

You will see that there is a lot of parallels and even repetition in abilities under different skills. For example problem solving, decision making and conflict resolution have a lot of similarity. That made me realize that even though there are "a lot" of skills and abilities, there are actually a set of core skills and habits that learners can master and then apply in many situations with some adaptation to the context. 

We could collapse those into one skill. Or we could leave them seperate for learners to see how they need to master the core set of abilities and then learn to adapt them. 

There are some connections to feedback and scoring in the way I built these skills. By making a detailed list of abilities that learners are scored on, we get learners into the habit of thinking through all of the steps to a challenge (or a regular task like meetings) before they start. After the challenge/task, they automatically take a few minutes to score how they did. My current idea is that reflection and scoring can become second nature and very quick. This builds a habit of self reflection and self awarness into all of the work they are doing. Rapid feedback is one of the key elements of people learning a skill. It increases the likelyhood of success before they do something. I am not sure how often they score themselves. It could be after each activity or at the end of the day. 

Looking ahead at levels -- the abilities could appear and disappear based on their level. Learners would work on the baseline abilities first. Once they master them, that ability set goes away and the next level has a new ability. For example, Collaboration has a skill called "Good meetings." A Level 0 ability is creating a good agenda. It disappears once the level up. In Level 1, a new ability appears called "Keeping participants focused." In Level 2, that disappears, and is replaced by "Using creative formats."The key is leveling these abilities so they align with the "Pull" of what is actually happening in the pod at the stage of development they are in. At the beginning, just making a good agenda is a skill. After they master that, they'll start to want to figure out how to facilitate better in the moment, to keep people focused. Once they get that skill, they will be curious about other ways to structure a meeting. That's the idea, anyway. Fitting the ability to the level will depend on how we develop feedback systems.

##Assessment 
Includes mentoring and feedback

At this point, I am putting mentorship under assessment to creates parallels. I know it is a vital skill, but I think it is actually strengthened if learners can break it down to its components (analysis, inquiry, feedback, appreciation), whether they are doing it with podmates, a mentee, or being mentored.  

**Giving Assessment** 
* Analyzing someone else’s work (Having trouble developing this one -- being able to analyze someone’s work is a discrete skill from giving feedback well)  * Technical work  * Non-tech (it’s a skills to go beyond “what I like/how I would do it”)

**Appreciative Inquiry**
* Asking questions that open up people’s understanding of their own work 

**Giving Feedback** 
(different than analyzing someone’s work -- this is the ability to communicate it effectively) 
* Kindness
* Accuracy
* Actionable

**Giving Appreciation and praise**   
**Mentoring** 
* Tracking Mentee over time 
* Fostering mentee’s ability to figure out their own answers
* Coaching 	

**Taking Assessment** 
* Listening 
* Balance ( holding your ground with accepting feedback) 
* Integrating and using feedback 
* Receiving praise 

**Analyzing quantitative data for the Pod**  -- Health and Skills (making meaning from feedback numbers)

**Integrating quantitative data with qualitative (human) assessment** for the Pod (This is a specific skill. I have watched a lot of learners struggle with it. I think it’s an effect of schooling -- information is compartmentalized into math, science, history -- so people often do not get practice integrating numbers and qualitative information until college). 



##Learning how to learn

**Formulating what your Pod does not know**
* Outlining the known unknowns 
* Finding the unknown unknowns 
* Defining desired learning outcomes 
	
**Making learning plan** (parallels “Problem Solving” ability)

* Integrating Pod learning diversity (advanced)    

**Tracking Effectiveness** 
* Analyzing outcomes for the pod (making meaning of the pod’s success or failures) 
* Tracking learning method effectiveness over time
* Tracking process effectiveness over time  
	
**Unschooling**
(This one needs more development)
* Understanding the imprints of school on the pod   * Mental   * Emotional   * Habits of mind  * Work habits 
	

##Technical Skill Sets  
**Information Systems** 
Many of our learners will be inexperienced with creating, maintaining and using a collective system of information. They will need to collective notes, resources, pod rules/decisions/agreements, data, communications. Even if we suggest ones, they will need to maintain it. 
	
**Creating a pod information system**
* Analyzing available tools and apps 
* Coordinating systems 
* Developing use rules (tags, etc) (combines with Decision Making)  

**Maintaining info systems** 
* Adhering to system rules 
* Using the system for Pod optimization
* Cleaning/ organizing system 
* Adapting/improving system to Pod’s use patterns
* Analyzing system effectiveness 

**Mentoring**
Technical mentoring has a specific set of skills. I don’t know what they are, though. 

* Tracking Mentee over time 
* Fostering mentee’s ability to figure out their own answers


**Interviewing** 
This was added to the Brain Dump by Tanner and Sherref. I need more information to develop it. I think it is better in Systemic Skills 	




#Qualities 
**Thoroughness/completeness**

**Clarity** -- the work is understandable and concise. 

**Flexibility** -- the activity/work balances needs of structure with adapting to evolving situations.

**Integration**  --  The work integrates and balances the many layers at play -- multiple people, dynamics and skills.

**Empathy** 

**Leadership** 

**Participation** -- meaning good followership and engagement, not just showing up. A good indicator would be leadership/participation scores compared. Imbalances would be a red flag on pod functioning. 

**Dynamism** -- was it engaging, fun, intriguing, well paced, compelling 

#Health

**Centeredness** -- I maintain center as I develop and practice these skills. Examples -- When I was co-working on a project, I checked in with myself and noticed I was taking on too much work, so I re-negotiated with my team. When I was facilitating and the meeting got boring, I pulled it together, noticed it and asked the group for their advice on how to rethink the agenda to be more useful. (NB -- This is my catch-all for No Drama and dealing with your shit) In the middle of the meeting when other people were getting angry, I stayed centered. 

**Integrity** -- I am honest and keep my word.

**Dignity** -- this one needs development. We need to track it. But the entire health stat may be an analog for dignity. 

**Inclusion** -- I include pod members and anyone else relevant to my work. I create a field where people are seen and valued.

**Resilience** -- I integrate disagreement, feedback, and failure to improve my work.

**Generosity** -- I share my ideas, my praise, my support, my attention. I help my podmates succeed and function at their best.

**Balance** -- I keep a healthy balance between the individual and the pod for myself and my pod mates.
