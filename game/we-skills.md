#Overview

The We Skills quadrant defines the interpersonal and group skills that learners use with other people, eg small group work, pairing, mentoring, their teams, also their families. This can also be called the "Social" skills quadrant. 

Skills in this catagory are defined by being used with people the learner is in contact with. There can be a blurry line with the systemic qudrant. For example, the line between having difficult conversations (We Skill) blurs with navigating discussions about oppression (Systemic Quadrant). The distinction is that Systemic skills focus on large scale groups/systems that the player does not have direct contact with at the time of the interaction. So, in a conversation with a teammate about sexism, knowing how to have a difficult conversation is a We skill -- the skill is navigating the conversation with the teammate -- while understanding how sexism is influencing the conversation is a Systemic skill because both people in the converation have been shaped by historic forces.

* Supporting pod member’s success 
* Empathy with pod members and the pod as a whole 
* Optimizing learning of the Pod 
	

##Assessment 
Includes mentoring and feedback

At this point, I am putting mentorship under assessment to creates parallels. I know it is a vital skill, but I think it is actually strengthened if learners can break it down to its components (analysis, inquiry, feedback, appreciation), whether they are doing it with podmates, a mentee, or being mentored.  

**Giving Assessment** 
* Analyzing someone else’s work (Having trouble developing this one -- being able to analyze someone’s work is a discrete skill from giving feedback well)  * Technical work  * Non-tech (it’s a skills to go beyond “what I like/how I would do it”)

**Appreciative Inquiry**
* Asking questions that open up people’s understanding of their own work 

**Giving Feedback** 
(different than analyzing someone’s work -- this is the ability to communicate it effectively) 
* Kindness
* Accuracy
* Actionable

**Giving Appreciation and praise**   
**Mentoring** 
* Tracking Mentee over time 
* Fostering mentee’s ability to figure out their own answers
* Coaching 	

**Taking Assessment** 
* Listening 
* Balance ( holding your ground with accepting feedback) 
* Integrating and using feedback 
* Receiving praise 

**Analyzing quantitative data for the Pod**  -- Health and Skills (making meaning from feedback numbers)

**Integrating quantitative data with qualitative (human) assessment** for the Pod (This is a specific skill. I have watched a lot of learners struggle with it. I think it’s an effect of schooling -- information is compartmentalized into math, science, history -- so people often do not get practice integrating numbers and qualitative information until college). 



##Learning how to learn

**Formulating what your Pod does not know**
* Outlining the known unknowns 
* Finding the unknown unknowns 
* Defining desired learning outcomes 
	
**Making learning plan** (parallels “Problem Solving” ability) 
* Defining the learning need
* Gathering input, evidence and people’s feelings  
* Effectively using input, evidence and people’s feelings
* Organizing learning tasks
* Listening 
* Using vareity of learning methods appropriate to the situation (advanced) 
* Effective use of support materials 
* Integrating Pod learning diversity (advanced)    

**Tracking Effectiveness** 
* Analyzing outcomes for the pod (making meaning of the pod’s success or failures) 
* Tracking learning method effectiveness over time
* Tracking process effectiveness over time  
	
**Unschooling**
(This one needs more development)
* Understanding the imprints of school on the pod   * Mental   * Emotional   * Habits of mind  * Work habits 
	

###Relational Intelligence

* Listen to different levels of a conversation, narrative, emotions, body language
* Ability to loop back what I have heard 
* Checking out perceptions regularly as a conversation progresses 
* Clarifying assumptions and misinterpretations
* Asking open ended questions
* Checking Assumptions
* Empathy


##Technical Skill Sets  
**Information Systems** 
Many of our learners will be inexperienced with creating, maintaining and using a collective system of information. They will need to collective notes, resources, pod rules/decisions/agreements, data, communications. Even if we suggest ones, they will need to maintain it. 
	
**Creating a pod information system**
* Analyzing available tools and apps 
* Coordinating systems 
* Developing use rules (tags, etc) (combines with Decision Making)  

**Maintaining info systems** 
* Adhering to system rules 
* Using the system for Pod optimization
* Cleaning/ organizing system 
* Adapting/improving system to Pod’s use patterns
* Analyzing system effectiveness 

**Mentoring**
Technical mentoring has a specific set of skills. I don’t know what they are, though. 

* Tracking Mentee over time 
* Fostering mentee’s ability to figure out their own answers


**Interviewing** 
This was added to the Brain Dump by Tanner and Sherref. I need more information to develop it. I think it is better in Systemic Skills 	




#Qualities 
**Thoroughness/completeness**

**Clarity** -- the work is understandable and concise. 

**Flexibility** -- the activity/work balances needs of structure with adapting to evolving situations.

**Integration**  --  The work integrates and balances the many layers at play -- multiple people, dynamics and skills.

**Empathy** -- the learner tracks and integrates the emotional relationships of people impacted by the work. 

**Leadership** -- the learner brings out the best qualities of everyone involved, balances the competing elements, and takes responsability for the outcomes. 

**Participation** -- meaning good followership and engagement, not just showing up. A good indicator would be leadership/participation scores compared. Imbalances would be a red flag on pod functioning. 

**Dynamism** -- was it engaging, fun, intriguing, well paced, compelling 

#Health

**Centeredness** -- I maintain center as I develop and practice these skills. Examples -- When I was co-working on a project, I checked in with myself and noticed I was taking on too much work, so I re-negotiated with my team. When I was facilitating and the meeting got boring, I pulled it together, noticed it and asked the group for their advice on how to rethink the agenda to be more useful. (NB -- This is my catch-all for No Drama and dealing with your shit) In the middle of the meeting when other people were getting angry, I stayed centered. 

**Integrity** -- I am honest and keep my word.

**Dignity** -- this one needs development. We need to track it. But the entire health stat may be an analog for dignity. 

**Inclusion** -- I include pod members and anyone else relevant to my work. I create a field where people are seen and valued.

**Resilience** -- I integrate disagreement, feedback, and failure to improve my work.

**Generosity** -- I share my ideas, my praise, my support, my attention. I help my podmates succeed and function at their best.

**Balance** -- I keep a healthy balance between the individual and the pod for myself and my pod mates.
