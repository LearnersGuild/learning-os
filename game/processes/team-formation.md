# Process: Team Formation

## Context

After a cycle starts, and before the next cycle begins there is a process of Goal Selection [goal-selection.md] followed by Team Formation. Team formation kicks in when a cycle's vote cutoff time arrives.

## Purpose

### Optimize for the following in order
- Team leads should be on as few teams as possible
- Players Lead to Membership Ratio (LMR) should be as close to 4 as possible
- Assign as many players as possible to Goals they have voted for
- Prefer teams of 4 players, followed by 3, followed by 5

### Requirements
- Team experience and skill level should be approximately equal, with the exception of 1 player who should be more experienced and skilled (Team Lead)
- No team should be without a lead
- Team members can only be on one team
- Teams should be no less than 3 and no more than 5 players
- A Team Lead's Build Days (BD) should be higher than their Team Members' average BD by 50 (10 weeks)
- If a Team Lead is assigned to two teams their BD should be higher than their Team Members' average BD by 100 (20 weeks)



## Inputs

- Goals from goal selection process
- Player votes on the goals (each goal has at least 3 players interested)
- Player stats (Build Days and LMR)

## Steps

1. Make sure you have enough Team Leads. Figure out who they are, and make sure there's enough of them (from there you'll determine team size, and wether or not Team Leads are doubling up)

2. Assign members and leads to goals
