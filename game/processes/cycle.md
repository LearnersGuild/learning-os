# Process: Cycle

## Context

All game play happens within a cycle. It is the primary game loop.
Cycles have a specific start date, and end date.

Cycles belong to a Chapter.

## Purpose

A cycle is the main organizing unit of the game. They are used to chunk up work, and provide the core rhythm of the game.

**1 Team works on 1 Goal Instance for 1 Cycle.**

Game moderators may wish to define set cycle durations to create consistency and synchronize team-formation across players, teams and cohorts that belong to a certain chapter.

Cycles also enable players to ground their statistics in some tangible sense of progress. Most stats are measured in terms of metric per cycle. Examples of how cycles _could_ be used to show progress:

- Feedback given, received, integrated per cycle
- RSGs achieved and failed per cycle
- Relative Contribution Delta per cycle

## Steps

1. [Goal Selection](goal-selection.md)
2. [Team Formation](team-formation.md)
3. Deliberate Practice
4. [Retrospective](retro.md)

## Stats Impacted

All of them!
