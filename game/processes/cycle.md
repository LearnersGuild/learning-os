## Process: Cycle

## Context

All game play happens within a cycle. It is the primary game loop.
Cycles have a specific start date, and end date.


## Purpose

A cycle is the main organizing unit of the game.
Cycles are used to chunk up work, and provide the core rhythm of the game.
They allow players to ground their statistics in some tangible sense of progress.

Most stats are measured in terms of metric per cycle. Examples of how cycles _could_ be used to show progress:

- Feedback given, received, integrated per cycle
- RSGs achieved and failed per cycle
- Relative Contribution Delta per cycle

## Steps

1. [Goal Selection](goal-selection.md)
2. [Team Formation](team-formation.md)
3. Deliberate Practice
4. [Retrospective](retro.md)

## Stats Impacted

All of them!
