# Process: Goal Selection

## Context

Goal selection is the first process in the [game cycle](cycle.md).
During goal selection, players indicate their commitment to participating in the cycle by voting for one or more Goal Templates.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Goal Selection process is to prepare for the Team Formation process by identifying:

- Players that are going to participate in the cycle
- Goal Templates these players are interested in
- Most popular Goal Templates for this cycle

Players indicate interest in goals
- Select goals from Goal Template library
- Group intelligence to narrow down goals templates for team formation

## Steps
- Players vote on Goal Templates[^1]
  - A vote on a goal means the player is interested in committing to this goal for the current cycle
  - Players can only vote once per goal
  - Players can vote for 1 to 3 goals
  - Players can change their votes any time during the goal selection process
- Goals where 3 or more players are interested are selected for team formation

## Stats Impacted

[^1]: Players only vote on goals they want to work on. they don't know they're going to be on team lead until team formation happens. Team leads don't get a formal say in what teams they will be leading, or what they'll be working on when they're team leading.
