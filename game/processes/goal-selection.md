# Process: Goal Selection

## Context

Goal selection is the first process in the [game cycle](cycle.md).
During goal selection, players indicate their commitment to participating in the cycle by voting for one or more Goal Templates.

## Purpose

The purpose of the Goal Selection process is to prepare for the Team Formation process by identifying:

- Players that are going to participate in the cycle
- Goal Templates these players are interested in
- Most popular Goal Templates for this cycle

Players indicate interest in goals
- Select goals from Goal Template library
- Group intelligence to narrow down goals templates for team formation

## Steps
- Players vote on Goal Templates[^1]
  - A vote on a goal means the player is interested in committing to this goal for the current cycle
  - Players can only vote once per goal
  - Players can vote for 1 to 3 goals
  - Players can change their votes any time during the goal selection process
- Goals where 3 or more players are interested are selected for team formation

## Stats Impacted

None

[^1]: Players only vote on goals they want to work on. they don't know they're going to be on team lead until team formation happens. Team leads don't get a formal say in what teams they will be leading, or what they'll be working on when they're team leading.



TODO: Read it and integrate it

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_transferable_vote *********** YES!

With a modification in that the same goal can be chosen TWICE!
And the votes being transferred are the ones that didn't get a preference the most (take PGSP into account as to who gets to work on their first choice)
We also need to calculate the PGSP based on who got which ranked preference.
