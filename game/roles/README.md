# Documentation: Roles

## Starting a Role

Players enter the game by playing as one or more roles. In order to take on a role, a player must _commit_ to that role's Role Contract.

For example, to become a Mentor (i.e. play the Mentor Role), you must commit to a Mentor Contract. By doing so, you would be agreeing to uphold the accountabilities of the Mentor role.

## Revoking a Role

Roles can be revoked, if a player breaches the terms of the Role Contract.

For example, if the terms of the Practitioner Role Contract state that the role is required to give feedback to a learner within 2 business days of a feedback request, and you have gone 5 days without responding to feedback, your Practitioner Role could be revoked.

When and how the revoking happens and by who is determined by the revoking process attached to the Role Contract.

## Role Attributes

There are multiple types of roles. All roles share the same attributes, but will have different values for each.

Every role contains (at minimum) the following attributes:

- Title
- Purpose
- Accountabilities
