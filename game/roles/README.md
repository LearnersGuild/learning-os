# Roles

In the game, Learners take on different roles.

## Role Attributes

There are multiple types of roles. All roles share the same attributes, but will have different values for each.

Every role contains (at minimum) the following attributes:

- Title
- Description
- Requirements
- Accountabilities
- Statistics

## Role Relationships

There are two core types of roles for Learners: [Team Leads](team-lead.md) and [Team Members](team-member.md).
