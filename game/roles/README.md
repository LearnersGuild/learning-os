# Roles

## Starting a Role

Players enter the game by playing as one or more roles. In order to take on a role, a player must _commit_ to that role's Role Contract.

For example, to become an Apprentice (i.e. play the Apprentice Role), you must commit to an Apprentice Contract. By doing so, you would be agreeing to uphold the accountabilities of the Apprentice role.

## Revoking a Role

Roles can be revoked, if a player breaches the terms of the Role Contract.

For example, if the terms of the Practitioner Role Contract state that the role is required to give feedback to a learner within 2 business days of a feedback request, and you have gone 5 days without responding to feedback, your Practitioner Role could be revoked.

When and how the revoking happens and by who is determined by the revoking process attached to the Role Contract.

## Role Attributes

There are multiple types of roles. All roles share the same attributes, but will have different values for each.

Every role contains (at minimum) the following attributes:

- Title
- Description
- Requirements
- Accountabilities
- Compensation
- Statistics

## Role Relationships

There are two core types of roles: [Learners](learner.md) and [Investors](investor.md).

Learners are focused on learning and practicing their craft with other Learners. Investors are focused on finding and sponsoring great Learners.

Learners can take on many other roles, depending on their progress within the game and other contexts.

The default lifecycle of a Learner is to take on roles in the following order:

1. [Learner](learner.md) (become member of the Guild)
1. [Applicant](applicant.md) (applied to be an Apprentice)
1. [Apprentice](apprentice.md) (supported/invested Learner)
1. [Team Member](team-member.md) (works on projects with a team)
1. [Team Lead](team-lead.md) (leads team projects)
1. [Practitioner](practitioner.md) (earns a salary to practice craft)

In this way a Learner moves through the game by always increasing their skill and responsibility to the collective.
