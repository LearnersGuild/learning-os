# Constants

Values that determine game behavior and are constant across the game mechanics.

When using these numbers in other game mechanics, refer to them by their constant name (ALL_CAPS_NO_SPACES), not their actual value.

|:-----------------|:------|
| MAX_TEAM_SIZE    | 5     |
| MIN_TEAM_SIZE    | 3     |
| TARGET_TEAM_SIZE | 4     |
