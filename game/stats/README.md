# Statistics

Statistics aggregate information from the [Contract Ledger](game-objects.md).

Their primary purpose is to give feedback to roles, in order to help roles answer questions like:

- What is my current state?
- How am I progressing toward my contract goals?
- Where am I in relation to other people in the system?
- How is the overall system doing?

Statistics, when used correctly, are the fuel that powers learning.
