# Statistics

Statistics aggregate information from the [Contract Ledger](game-objects.md).

Their primary purpose is to give feedback to roles, in order to help roles answer questions like:

- What is my current state?
- How am I progressing toward my contract goals?
- Where am I in relation to other people in the system?
- How is the overall system doing?

Statistics, when used correctly, are the fuel that powers learning.

## Assessment Accuracy (AA)

TODO: Flesh out assessment Accuracy

## Build Days (BD)

Total number of days a player led a team in Deliberate Practice as a Team Member or Team Lead. (Lead Days + Membership Days = Build Days)

## Lead Days (LD)

Total number of days a player led a team in Deliberate Practice as a Team Lead

## Membership Days (MD)

Total number of days a player joined a team in Deliberate Practice as a Team Member

## Lead to Membership Ratio (LMR)

Ratio of Lead Days to Membership Days expressed as 1 number.
For example, if a player had 5 lead days, and 20 membership days, her ration would be 1:4, and her LMR would be expressed as 4.
