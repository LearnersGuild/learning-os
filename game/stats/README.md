# Statistics

Statistics aggregate information from the [Contract Ledger](game-objects.md).

Their primary purpose is to give feedback to roles, in order to help roles answer questions like:

- What is my current state?
- How am I progressing toward my contract goals?
- Where am I in relation to other people in the system?
- How is the overall system doing?

Statistics, when used correctly, are the fuel that powers learning.

## Assessment Accuracy (AA)

TODO: Flesh out assessment Accuracy

## Build Days (BD)

Total number of days a player led a team in Deliberate Practice as a Team Member or Team Lead. (Lead Days + Membership Days = Build Days)

## Preferred Goal Selection Percentage (PGSP)

Percentage of time that a player voted for a goal and got assigned to it.

## Lead Days (LD)

Total number of days a player led a team in Deliberate Practice as a Team Lead

## Membership Days (MD)

Total number of days a player joined a team in Deliberate Practice as a Team Member

## Lead to Membership Ratio (LMR)

Ratio of Lead Days to Membership Days expressed as 1 number.
For example, if a player had 5 lead days, and 20 membership days, her ration would be 1:4, and her LMR would be expressed as 4.

## Relative Contribution

## Relative Contribution Delta (RCD)

TODO: Flesh out RCD
Should team size be a factor in it? +10% on a team of 2 is different than +10% on a team of 5
Related to assessment accuracy

## Total Contribution

TODO: Flesh out Total Contribution

If RCD calculates their relative contribution compared to teams they've worked on. It is a relative number.
Total Contribution is a cumulative number. It is a function of the total Build Days and the Relative Contribution Delta.

For example, Karim might have 100 BD, and an RCD of +5%. Meanwhile Omoju has 50 BD and an RCD of +10%.

Karim's Total Contribution is 105 (100 * (1 + 5%))
Omoju's Total Contribution is 55 (100 * (1 + 10%))

Karim has more experience, while Omoju on average, contributes more of her fair share on Goals on a relative basis than Karim.


TODO: Maybe get rid of build days? Or make Build days what Total contribution is supposed to be
