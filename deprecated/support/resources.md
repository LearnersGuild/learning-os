# Support: Resources

## Prep Resources

1. Pod application form
2. Learners Guild communication software, e.g. chat room
3. Physical geme-play space
4. A Mentor per 15-20 **PlayersInPrep**, to be deprecated post v2.
	- Mentor's sole job is to find out what support is needed for **PlayersInPrep** to succeed, and to help find or create the resources they need.
	- After v2, these supports would be grafted as Player Support materials for Admission’s Game.
5. Assistance to **PlayerInPrep**s based on *need* to be trigger when **PlayerInPrep** reaches a certain level in the admission’s game
	- v0
		- Child care voucher
		- Loaner laptops for in person game-play
	-  v2 and on
		- Child care voucher
		- Use of Guild computers for a specified number of hours

## Game Resources
- Technical curriculum
  - Some material are necessary to level up
  - Materials should reflect LG values of inclusion, diversity, and social impacts
- Social-and-Emotional Literacy curriculum
  - Some materials are necessary to level up
  - Materials should reflect LG values of inclusion, diversity, and social impacts
- Curated bank of resources, created by LG and added to by players. Reddit-like system of ratings. Players get treasure points for posting to it and for high ratings.
- Learners Guild issued laptop
- Stipend ($2,000 / month per Player)
- Physical game-play space (e.g.,  stations for Pairs, whiteboards, meeting areas, tables, chairs, etc.)
- Software systems (e.g., group chat, remote-collaboration software, scoreboards)


## Player Resource System

Spiral learning model -- begins highly structured, each loop of the spiral gives more autonomy to players in the challenges and resources they use.

At this point, there are four level:

1. "YES Jam"  style Orientation beginning with deep introduction to non-technical curricula and meta-cognition. An experiential 1 - 2 week personality bootcamp where players experience
1. Seeded Learning. in both tech and non-tech curricula. Challenges integrate both. Resources are made available and suggested. Each week has a seeded lesson, challenges that practice those lessons, and a reflection on the accomplishment and practice at the end of the week.
1. Partial seeding.  Tech curricula continues to be seeded for each week. Non-tech curricula tapers off and pods begin to select what they will work on and what resources they will access.
1. Self Directed. (Wild Crafting) Pods are choosing what they will work on and what resources they want to access.

To advance a level, pods have to have reached a health and skill levels. They pass a boss challenge in tech and non-tech curricula (that could also be an integrated challenge).  

In the early levels, pods are learning how to self evaluate through the integration of personal experience and data in order to make decisions about what they need to learn and work on. The feedback loops are tight and highly structured. In higher levels, they are doing their own analysis and making those choices tailored to their interests, passions and deepening of practice.

Missions in the early phase can be structured and then have added levels of complexity in the later spiral levels.

### Example Missions

First Level: build Yoyo chat board for client X in pairs.
Second Level: similar challenge, adding that client x makes unreasonable demands, sending emails to each member playing them off against each other
