# Support: Strategies

## Invitation to Play
Â Anyone can join the "Admission's" game by simply filling out a game Admissions form. We will work extensively with our community partners to ensure we have a solid sample of individuals who are historically underrepresented in software engineering.

Once persons have demonstrated interest in joining the admission's game, they are given access to Learners Guild online chat platform, where they can start building community with other potential Aspirants.

### Metaphor

The "*golden ticket*" conceptual metaphor from Charlie and the chocolate factory has been suggested as a cognitive framing of the invitation to play. We want our Players to feel like this is a very special, VIPesque, once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to participate in an exclusive experience that is designed to transform their lives for the better. Everything about the invitation should have the feeling of luxury, aspiration and exclusivity around it. By the time Aspirants become Players, they would have known that they earned their place in their respective pods.

## Pod formation

All potential Aspirants are told that Learners Guild will have to slots opened for Pods by a certain date. For example, all potential Aspirants will be informed that the Oakland guild will be taking applications to fill two pods scheduled to launch July 2016.

The rules are simple:
- Only teams are allowed to apply to become pods. However, anyone can apply to play the game.
- In order for teams to apply, certain criteria must be met of **all** individual team members.
  - These criteria are the criteria set for by this document as "Talent Requirements."
  - Teams have a better chance of gaining acceptance if they not only meet the non-negotiable talent requirements, but also have skills and traits to conform to the nice to haves.

## GamePlay Hackathons

Learners Guild and/or its community partners will host gameplay Hackathons where individuals can come together, and go through challenges together. The challenges are designed to help individuals learn more about the LG game as a sandboxed, community learning incubator. Some of the challenges may be designed by our community partners to solve some present need.
