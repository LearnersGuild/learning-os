# Player Support

**Given the materials in this folder, a partner will be able to initialize a new location and build out amazing support systems for their pod.**

## Roles

### Coach
A Coach are helpers and strategists that support Players and Pods as they move through the game. Their role is primarily one of support, specifically as it applies to maintaining the cohesion and wellbeing of the Pods and their game-play environment. Day-to-day, they will facilitate conversations among and between Pods and Players.

#### Sourcing
Initially our Coaches are sourced externally from the industry, as we scale, we will source Coaches from a pool of Players who have completed 40 levels of the game and are seeking to level up by completing challenges that require points obtained from coaching.

### Practitioner
A Practitioner is an expert resource to be called-upon by Players and Pods as they move through the game terrain. Specifically, practitioners are seasoned professionals in web development and / or software engineering.
#### Sourcing
To start off, our Practitioners are sourced from industry. However as we scale, our Practitioners will be sourced from a pool of Players who have completed 40 levels of the game and are seeking to level up by completing challenges that require points obtained from service as a an expert.

### Facilitator
A Facilitator is an external resource that is called upon if Players and Pods need additional supports beyond what their Coach can provide in ensuring the wellbeing of the Pod.

#### For version 0
- An expressed desire to be a software engineer in a supportive but challenging environment.
- An expressed willingness to making a commitment to self-transformation through social-emotional training.
- An attainment of a minimum age of 25 years.
  - This gives the pilot pod for the LG game a few less hurdles to face. With the understanding that players who are leveling up from to placed web developers are going to face challenges around race, gender, income and so on. To mitigate the risk of pod failure, we have decided to punt to v1, the challenge of 'ageism.'
- Previous employment history or an alternate demonstration of responsibility
  - We are specifically interested in a demonstration of responsibility that indicates a players ability to navigate family needs, transportation, housing, and co-worker dynamics.
- Availability to participate full-time for 40 weeks

#### For version 1
- [All v0 requirements with the amendment of]
- An attainment of a minimum age of 21 years.

In addition, the negotiable (non-required, but nice to have) traits of pod-eligible players are:

- An identification with a historically underrepresented group in the software engineering workforce like:
  - Women
  - Ethnic-minority
  - LGBTQ, gender non-conforming
  - Persons with disabilities
  - Persons from a low-income environment
- A belief that inclusion is an overall net positive effect in the software engineering field.

### PlayerInPrep
A person who has gained acceptance to the LG game, but is presently confined to prep challenges. This person starts out at Level 0, upon completing all prep challenges advances to Level 1.


## Prep
Prep is designed to be no more than **a month**.

The ideal scenario, what ever the form that player-support exists in before the start of the official LG Game, it should not include the man hours of LG partners. Why? Because it won’t ultimately scale

#### Number of weeks :
50 hours of Prep to be done over 4 weeks.
#### Hours dedicated by partners to PS :
6 hours at 3 hours a meet up
#### Hours dedicated by Paid Mentors to PS :
Approximately 10 hours a week, for 4 weeks.  

## Non-Technical Talent Requirement
The ideal player should come into the games with the following non-negotiable disposition defined along the following dimensions:

### Grit

### Distance Travelled
Distance travelled is a concept that seeks to quantify the path of a potential aspirant outside of orthodox ability measurements like GPA, SAT and so forth. It is a recognition of the progress a potential learners has made that may not be visible when compared to traditional learners. A consideration of distance travelled is very important in contextualizing potential Aspirants’ achievements.
	- They can share where they came from to where they are in terms of their knowledge
		- Example:
			- I dropped out of high school in the 10th grade, with a 2.4 GPA. Since then, I have taken the GED, applied to community college, and finished with a 3.0 GPA.
