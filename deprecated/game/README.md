# The Game

The components of our Applied Game consist of the [Mechanics](mechanics.md), or how the game works, and the [Terrain](terrain.md), or where the game is played. The [Terrain Architecture](terrain-architecture.md) describes the terrain types and the high-level map of the terrain.

**Given the material within this folder, a pod will be able to start playing the game from start to finish.**

Our Applied Game is designed with a game-enhanced learning approach and based in principles of learning theory .

These three paradigms all coexist in our LOS.

1. As curriculum builders, we adhere to principles of good curriculum design.
1. As game designers, we use concepts and mechanics from the world of gaming.
1. As learning designers, we craft a Learning Operating System in terms and with a UI/UX that learners will relate to and be able to transfer to an environment of practice.

The relationship between these three paradigms is expressed in this *terminology map*:

| Curriculum / Learning Theory           | Game Theory            | Applied Game                 |
|----------------------------------------|------------------------|------------------------------|
| Subject Area (discipline, topic)       | World, Realm           | Domain [Terrain]             |
| Outcome (skill, ability)               | Level                  | Skill [Mechanic]             |
| Grade                                  | Experience Points (XP) | Skill Points (SP) [Mechanic] |
| Objective (knowledge, habit, belief)   | Small Game, Puzzle     | Objective [Mechanic]         |
| Exam (test, assessment, final project) | Quest, Dungeon         | Mission [Terrain]            |
| Assignment                             | Boss Level             | Project [Terrain]            |
| Defined Task (learning activity)       | Challenge              | Exercise [Terrain]           |
| Evidence (evaluation, metric)          | Challenge Completion   | Deploy, Push [Terrain]       |

## Resolution

Our Applied Game has some general rules about _time resolution_, i.e. how long it should take to complete nodes and move through the map.

These are meant to be guidelines, not strict rules. The more we follow them, the more consistent our game experience will be (and consistency is good).

| Activity          | Time       |
|-------------------|------------|
| Finish game       | 40 weeks   |
| Explore domain    | 1-3 weeks  |
| Complete mission  | 2-5 days   |
| Deploy project    | 1-2 days   |
| Practice exercise | 1-2 hours  |
| Utilize materials | 10-40 mins |
