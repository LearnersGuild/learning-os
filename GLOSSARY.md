# Human Development

Human Development is the phrase used to refer to the craft-agnostic learning modules and other similar content offered at Learners Guild. The practice of learning Human Development skills at Learners Guild includes the study of four core competencies: meta-learning (learning to learn), self-efficacy, collaboration, and navigating systems.

# Unlearning

Learning is happening all the time, in both functional and dysfunctional ways and is influenced by past experiences of learning, both functional and dysfunctional. Unlearning is to examine the way that one learns, explore what has influenced the ways that one learns, examine the efficacy of the ways that one learns, and discard, or unlearn, those ways that are not effective.
