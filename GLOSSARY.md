# Cycle

The primary unit of time by which progress is measured. Cycles start with goal-setting, and end with a reflection/retrospective. Player support may wish to define set cycle durations to create consistency across players and teams.

# Stage

A section of the game through which players advance towards victory. Stages correspond to roles; moving a higher stage is analogous to acquiring a role with greater power and responsibility.

# Unlearning

Learning is happening all the time, in both functional and dysfunctional ways and is influenced by past experiences of learning, both functional and dysfunctional. Unlearning is to examine the way that one learns, explore what has influenced the ways that one learns, examine the efficacy of the ways that one learns, and discard, or unlearn, those ways that are not effective.
