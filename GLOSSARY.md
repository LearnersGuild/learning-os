# Ability

Capacities, knowledge, and beliefs the player acquires through attempting challenges. Abilities belong to an Ability Set, which belongs to a Skill level, which belongs to a Skill. Abilities are also linked from challenges that demand/develop them.

Abilities have four states (for each player)

* Locked: Meaning the player has not yet attempted any challenges that list this ability. Locked abilities cannot be claimed.
* Unlocked: The ability has been practiced by the player through a challenge, but the player has not yet claimed it.
* Claimed: The player is announcing that they have grocked this ability.
* Checked Off: A higher-ranked player has worked with the player on this ability, and has verified that they have grocked it.

# Ability Set

# Behavior Set

A collection of behaviors that define a Health Stat.

# Challenge

# Challenge Set

# Evaluation Rubrics

# Health Stat

# Pair Up

A Pair Up happens once a player has claimed all the abilities in a skill level's ability set and is ready to level up. A higher ranked player pairs with the player who is claiming a skill level, and checks off their abilities through working together on a challenge, or a code review. Players must pair up at least twice, and have all their abilities checked off in order to level up.

# Player Skill Level

The sum of all the skill levels for the player.

# Skill Stat

A player stat that tracks their level, experience, and abilities in a particular skill.

# Skill Level

A skill is made up of skill levels. A number that tracks the development of a player in a particular skill. Skill levels start at 0.

Each level is achieved through gaining experience, and abilities.  Once  XP and abilities reach a "leveling up threshold, there's a "leveling up challenge" that levels the skill up the next level, and resets XP and abilities to 0 for that level. Each consecutive level requires more XP and abilities gained to achieve.

# Quality Description

A Quality Description is part of a Quality Rubric. It describes how a particular challenge should be evaluated for a particular Quality Stat. While the list of Quality Stats in the game is relatively stable, as the player advances through challenges, the Quality Descriptions for the same rubric will change.

For example, the Quality Stat "Code Readability" might initially have the Quality Description "Has good indentation." As the player levels up, a more advanced Quality Rubric for a challenge might describe "Code Readability" as "No obvious comments. Short, precise comments where needed. Consistent naming scheme. Limited line length. Files and folders well organized."

# Quality Rubric

A Quality Stat, and Quality Description associated with a certain challenge that determine how a player's work for that particular challenge is evaluated.

# Quality Stat

A player stat that tracks the quality/precision of play for that player.
