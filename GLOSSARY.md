# Unlearning

Learning is happening all the time, in both functional and dysfunctional ways and is influenced by past experiences of learning, both functional and dysfunctional. Unlearning is to examine the way that one learns, explore what has influenced the ways that one learns, examine the efficacy of the ways that one learns, and discard, or unlearn, those ways that are not effective.
