A skill is made up of skill levels. A number that tracks the development of a player in a particular skill. Skill levels start at 0.

Each level is achieved through gaining experience, and abilities.  Once  XP and abilities reach a "leveling up threshold, there's a "leveling up challenge" that levels the skill up the next level, and resets XP and abilities to 0 for that level. Each consecutive level requires more XP and abilities gained to achieve.

# Quality Description

A Quality Description is part of a Quality Rubric. It describes how a particular challenge should be evaluated for a particular Quality Stat. While the list of Quality Stats in the game is relatively stable, as the player advances through challenges, the Quality Descriptions for the same rubric will change.

For example, the Quality Stat "Code Readability" might initially have the Quality Description "Has good indentation." As the player levels up, a more advanced Quality Rubric for a challenge might describe "Code Readability" as "No obvious comments. Short, precise comments where needed. Consistent naming scheme. Limited line length. Files and folders well organized."

# Quality Rubric
