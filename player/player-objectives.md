# Player Objectives

#### Purpose
Player objectives define what we want player to achieve at the end of the game. They are the real outcomes of our applied/serious game.

#### Usage
When designing game mechanics or player support, use these as both inspiration and razor.

Design with these objectives in mind, and check implementations against them. If a contract, process, statistic, or player support offering doesn't drive learners towards these objectives, it should probably be removed.
