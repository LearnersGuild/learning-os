**Quick Pick RSG Prioritization Exercise**

 - What tasks do you see others doing that you would like to be able to
   do yourself but haven’t? 
 - Pick one and try it.
 - Pick someone you’ve seen do it to help you if needed. [if they never end up needing help, it wasn’t stretchy enough] 
 - Record the amount of
   help you need completing the task as feedback for future RSG picking)

**Embodied RSG Prioritization Exercise**

* What tasks did you recently do that you feel you could do again on your own?
* What tasks do you see others doing that you would like to be able to do yourself but haven’t?
* Of the tasks that you have seen others do, which ones seem related to the ones you’ve recently done yourself?
* Which tasks do you really want to be able to do yourself?
* Which tasks do you think are the most valuable to making progress towards your ultimate goal of sustained employment as a Software Developer?
* What feels like the strongest overlap between these two?
* Go for it. Use people around you. Track your progress and who or what helped along the way.

**Algorithmic RSG Prioritization Exercise**

* Make a column of the tasks you’ve done and a column of the tasks you’ve seen others do.
* Relate the columns to each other, matching items that you feel are similar to each other, making as many matches as you want
* Rank the tasks in the “others performed” column in order of # of matches to tasks in the “I’ve performed” column (highest to lowest)
* Pick a task in the middle of the order and try it, calling on the person who you’ve seen perform it for support.  

**Create your own RSG Prioritization Strategy**

* After trying each of the ones above, feel free to modify them or make your own strategy. Document it here:
1. How I identify possible goals…
2. How I decide if they are stretchy…
3. How I decide if they are relevant…
4. How I approach them…
5. The feedback I look for to get better at setting and achieving them...


All of these need a relevancy match mechanism…

For relevancy the key factor is the following…
