#RSG Picker
-------
At Learners Guild, we believe that consistently setting and achieving relevant stretch goals is key to accelerating your learning and professional development. We also believe that you will learn faster and more effectively if you leverage people with more experience and people with less experience than yourself. To help you set relevant stretch goals and get the most benefit from the community of learners around you, we've put together three exercises to try out. You can try each one on your own or with a team to create a list of goals and prioritize them based on their relevance and level of challenge to you. 

Give each of the following a try and then modify one or craft your own based on your experiences.

**Quick Pick RSG Prioritization Exercise**

 - What tasks do you see others doing (either online or in Learners Guild) that you would like to be able to do yourself but haven’t?
 - Get someone to help you decide which task seems most important for you to try right now. 
 - Try it.
 - Pick someone you’ve seen do it to help you if needed. [if you never end up needing help, it wasn’t stretchy enough] 
 - Record the amount of help you need completing the task as feedback for future RSG picking)

**Embodied RSG Prioritization Exercise**

* What tasks did you recently do (either online or in Learners Guild) that you feel you could do again on your own?
* What tasks do you see others doing that you would like to be able to do yourself but haven’t?
* Of the tasks that you have seen others do, which ones seem related to the ones you’ve recently done yourself?
* Which tasks do you really want to be able to do yourself?
* Which tasks do you think are the most valuable to making progress towards your ultimate goal of sustained employment as a Software Developer?
* Pick the task that feels like the strongest overlap between these two lists.
* Go for it. Use people around you. Track your progress and who or what helped along the way.

**Algorithmic RSG Prioritization Exercise**

* Make a column of the tasks you’ve done and a column of the tasks you’ve seen others do.
* Relate the columns to each other, matching items that you feel are similar to each other, making as many matches as you want
* Rank the tasks in the “others performed” column in order of # of matches to tasks in the “I’ve performed” column (highest to lowest)
* Send the ranked list to a Practitioner for a relevancy ranking.
* Given the final prioritized list based on relevancy and overlap, pick a task near the top of the order and try it, calling on the person who you’ve seen perform it for support.  

**Create your own RSG Prioritization Strategy**

* After trying each of the ones above, feel free to modify them or make your own strategy. Document it here:
1. How I identify possible goals…
2. How I decide if they are stretchy…
3. How I decide if they are relevant…
4. How I approach them…
5. The feedback I look for to get better at setting and achieving them...
