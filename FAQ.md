## How does a pod "die"?

There are two ways for a pod to die / fail / dissolve:

1. Pods dissolve when all of their members fail (according to terms of the [investor-learner contract](./game/contracts/investor-learner.md))
1. Pods dissolve when at least 1/2 of their members fail, and the remaining members decide to join another pod.

Condition #2 is reached after Player Support (Facilitator) steps in when 1/2 of a pod fails and offers the remaining members the option of dissolving and each member joining another pod (most likely they would be split between the pods in the next cohort).

If the pod requests, the Facilitator runs a decision-making process for the pod to decide collectively which road to take. The Facilitator will attempt to bring the pod to consensus, and failing that will take a majority vote.
