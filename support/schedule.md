# Schedule & Format

## Overview

The player support schedule and format are meant to support and augment the LG game, and are not necessarily a part of it.

The way the schedule is structured is meant to achieve the following goals:

- Maximize cross phase pollination: Allows relationship building across phases, supports the culture being maintained and passed on, and mitigates the risk and work of re-creating the culture with every new cohort
- Accommodate facilitator availability: Our facilitators are a rare and precious resource. They are the bottle neck of our scaling and how/when player support curriculum can be delivered/facilitated
- No whiplash effect: After heavy emotional and cognitive lift, learners might just want to go home and could have a tough time context switching back to coding, or might want to choose to spend time reflecting and integrating
- Same phase bonding: There is a shared arc of experience for a group of the same cohort. The schedule & format is meant to nurture this bond and build on it
- Some facilitator pairing: Skill sharing. Prevent isolation and burnout. Create slack
- Support maker time: Long chunks of distraction free time
- Create a heartbeat: Sustained, consistent, reliable rhythm
- Makes the game work for players who are parents
- Prevents burnout (marathon not sprint)
- 40 hours of deliberate coding practice per week

## Home Groups

The home group is made up of 12 to 15 players of the same cohort (started on the same day, at the same location).
The home group meets once a week at the end of the day starting at 5 o'clock. Meetings run from 1.5 to 2 hours.

- For the first quarter (2 phases or 10 weeks) the meetings are run by 2 facilitators.
- For the second and third quarter the meetings are run by 1 facilitator.
- For the fourth quarter and onwards the meetings are self-facilitated.

### Facilitator Home Group Schedule
Each facilitator is responsible for facilitating 4 groups at any one time:

- Two home groups in quarter 1 (pairing)
- One home group in quarter 2 (solo)
- One home group in quarter 3 (solo)

### Weekly Home Group Schedule for 8 pods spread across 4 quarters
- Monday: Quarter 1.a (2 facilitators)
- Tuesday: Quarter 1.b (2 facilitators)
- Wednesday: Quarter 2.a, 2.b (1 facilitator each)
- Thursday: Quarter 3.a, 3.b (1 facilitator each)
- Thursday: Quarter 4.a, 4.b (self-facilitated)

## Check-in Groups
Once a week, during lunch, there is a check-in group. Check-in groups are cross-phase, and have 3 to 5 people from each quarter in them.

Over lunch, players take turns checking in for 2 minutes each about their lives. Check-in groups are optional, and a facilitator may or may not be there. It's also possible that there will be an assigned mentor/mentee per learner from their check-in group.

Check-in groups will be trained on an LG-checkin protocol.
