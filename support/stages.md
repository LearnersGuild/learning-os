## Stages

### Advancement with Stages

Stages are sections through which players advance towards victory.

Stage transitions include a rite of passage, conferring greater responsibility and privileges to the player.

Each stage corresponds to a separate role in the game. New players start at the lowest stage/role, and advance to higher stages by earning more powerful roles.

There are a total of 6 stages to the game (starting at 0), each corresponding to a different role:

1. **Stage 0: Aspirant**
1. **Stage 1: Apprentice**
1. **Stage 2: Mentor**
1. **Stage 3: Agent**
1. **Stage 4: Creator**
1. **Stage 5: Practitioner**

Like cycles, stages are not time-bound. They serve as opportunities to recognize and celebrate significant transformation events in a player's advancement.
