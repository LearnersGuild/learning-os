## Stages

### Advancement with Stages

Stages are sections of player support through which players advance towards victory.

Stage transitions include a rite of passage, a recognition of greater responsibility and privileges conferred to the player.

There are a total of 4 stages to the game (starting at 0):

1. **Stage 0: First Apprenticeship**
1. **Stage 1: Team Leadership**
1. **Stage 2: Community Participation**
1. **Stage 3: Livelihood Creation**

Like phases, stages are time-bound. They are equal to 2 phases. They serve as opportunities to recognize and celebrate significant transformation events in a player's advancement.
