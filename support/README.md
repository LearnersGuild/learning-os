## Roles

### Coach
A Coach are helpers and strategists that support Players and Pods as they move through the game. Their role is primarily one of support, specifically as it applies to maintaining the cohesion and wellbeing of the Pods and their game-play environment. Day-to-day, they will facilitate conversations among and between Pods and Players.

#### Sourcing
Initially our Coaches are sourced externally from the industry, as we scale, we will source Coaches from a pool of Players who have completed 40 levels of the game and are seeking to level up by completing challenges that require points obtained from coaching.

### Practitioner
A Practitioner is an expert resource to be called-upon by Players and Pods as they move through the game terrain. Specifically, practitioners are seasoned professionals in web development and / or software engineering.
