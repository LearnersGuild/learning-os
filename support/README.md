## Roles

### Coach
A Coach are helpers and strategists that support Players and Pods as they move through the game. Their role is primarily one of support, specifically as it applies to maintaining the cohesion and wellbeing of the Pods and their game-play environment. Day-to-day, they will facilitate conversations among and between Pods and Players.
