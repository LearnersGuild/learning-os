# Player Support

**Given the materials in this folder, a partner will be able to initialize a new location and build out amazing support systems for their pod.**

## Roles

### Coach
A Coach are helpers and strategists that support Players and Pods as they move through the game. Their role is primarily one of support, specifically as it applies to maintaining the cohesion and wellbeing of the Pods and their game-play environment. Day-to-day, they will facilitate conversations among and between Pods and Players.

#### Sourcing
Initially our Coaches are sourced externally from the industry, as we scale, we will source Coaches from a pool of Players who have completed 40 levels of the game and are seeking to level up by completing challenges that require points obtained from coaching.

### Practitioner
A Practitioner is an expert resource to be called-upon by Players and Pods as they move through the game terrain. Specifically, practitioners are seasoned professionals in web development and / or software engineering.
#### Sourcing
To start off, our Practitioners are sourced from industry. However as we scale, our Practitioners will be sourced from a pool of Players who have completed 40 levels of the game and are seeking to level up by completing challenges that require points obtained from service as a an expert.

### Facilitator
A Facilitator is an external resource that is called upon if Players and Pods need additional supports beyond what their Coach can provide in ensuring the wellbeing of the Pod.

### PlayerInPrep

## Prep
Prep is designed to be no more than **a month**.

The ideal scenario, what ever the form that player-support exists in before the start of the official LG Game, it should not include the man hours of LG partners. Why? Because it wonâ€™t ultimately scale

#### Number of weeks :
50 hours of Prep to be done over 4 weeks.
#### Hours dedicated by partners to PS :
6 hours at 3 hours a meet up
#### Hours dedicated by Paid Mentors to PS :
Approximately 10 hours a week, for 4 weeks.
