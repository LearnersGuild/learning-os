#Player Support Arc 

**Stage** 1 is Enculturation and foundational skills building. 

**Stage 2** mostly has Learners to pick the topics that are relevant to them. The exceptions are modules that support their ability to lead.

**Stage** 3 has no mandatory modules. 

**Stage 4** has mandatory modules for the first 4 weeks to set them up for their job search. 

The mandatory modules all create a common language and systems for players in LG. While they are mandatory, which is in tension with the “Enable self-organization & self-determination,” the creation of common systems and language helps us “Sustain the tension between individual and collective gain.” 

Many of the optional modules are critical information, but are not mandatory. The goal is to create modules Learners really want, but do not have to take. 


Learners can do more than 1 module a week. If a Homegroup decides that their Stretch Goal for a week is to improve their group dynamics, they can request a second module. 

This is also built on a system where learners can break from their Home Group and form a team to study a module.

##Module Categories

**Learning to Learn** 

**Self-Awesomeness**  

**Collaboration** 

**Navigating Systems** 

<br />

##Stage 1 

Player support starts front-loads Enculturation. See the Human Systems Stage 1 doc for a more detailed initial outline of the weeks’ schedule

While these are outlines as individual modules, the first two weeks are our Enculturation Jam. The overarching goal is to give Learners an experience of a highly functional, authentic, communicative and supportive collective. There is a lot of information, but they do not have to remember it all as if they were in a workshop and were going home afterwards. The material in the first 2 weeks are the culture of LG. Learners will be practicing them with each other and see them modeled by LG staff and Learners ahead of them.
