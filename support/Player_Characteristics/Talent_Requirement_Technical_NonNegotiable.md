### Non-Negotiable Technical Talent Requirement

## Computational Thinking
The ideal player should come into the game with a technical talent aptitude assessed by the use of validated "computational thinking" and/or "technical talent" assessment.

These assessment should be a simulation which indicates an aspirants ability to do:
- Algorithmic notions of control flow
	- Example: Successfully [traversing](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cqddqb3mbad04pk/thoughtWorks%20006.jpg?dl=0) a flow chart
- Abstraction
	- Example: Finding the common pattern in different groups of concepts
- Conditional thinking 
	- Example: Successfully traversing a flow chart with logic based decisions
- Symbol systems and representation 
	- A simple translation task based on a given code system, for example translating from emojis to full sentences
- Problem decomposition
	- Example: how would you tell someone to draw a face
		- Level 1: Tell them to draw a face. The problem cannot be abstracted much more than this.
		- Level 2: Divide the face into components (eyes, ears, nose, mouth) and tell them to draw the specific components. Note that you need instructions to describe spatial relationships.
		- Level 3: Describe the face as a series of line segments or arcs in particular locations, lengths and orientations.
		- Level 4: Describe the face as a set of points that are drawn (stippling). Each point is defined by an (x, y) position.
- Iterative thinking
	- Some have argued the addition of recursive and parallel thinking, but I believe these can be scaffolded on iterative thinking





Examples of assessment materials can be found at [CS unplugged](http://csunplugged.org/), [Bebras](http://www.bebraschallenge.org/), as well as other resources that cater to a development of computational thinking. Similar assessment of "algorithmic notions of control flow" have been developed by Thoughtworks corporation. These assessments have proved to be a strong indicator of software engineering aptitude. 

## Programming
The ideal player should come into the games with a minimum of 40 to 50 hours of prior programming knowledge as defined along the following dimensions:
- Programming Experience (Crude understanding of):

	- Arrays / lists 
	- Functions
	- Object Oriented Programming

## Web Development
- Web Development Experience (Crude understanding of):
	- HTTP methods
	- Databases
	- Encryption
	- Web Services API

## Language
- Language Experience (Fluency with):
	- English
