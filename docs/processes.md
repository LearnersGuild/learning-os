# Documentation: Processes

A process is defined by four simple attributes:

- Purpose
- Steps
- Results

The purpose explains why this process exists and who can/should use it.
The steps dictate how to execute the process.
The results define what change the process creates.

## Example Process: Requesting Guidance

**Purpose:**<br>
To aid learners in requesting guidance on their learning. In contrast to requesting feedback, which happens _after_ an action is taken, _guidance_ is often needed to help determine _how_ to take action.

**Steps:**<br>
1. Respond to the question: "What do you want guidance on?"
1. Respond to the prompt: "Describe the problem in detail."
1. Respond to the question: "Which options have you considered?"
1. Combine questions/prompts and their responses into one block of text, with lines separating each question/prompt.
1. Post the text to the #guidance-request channel in the LOS chat.

**Results:**
A new guidance request is added to a request queue. This queue is used in the Offering Guidance process.
