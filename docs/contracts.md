# Documentation: Contracts

### Working with Contracts

The contract is the core object in the LOS. It is a highly versatile and powerful tool for defining goals and protocols for relationships between roles.

At their essence, contracts are an agreement between two parties. In some cases, those two parties are the same person, in other cases they are one or more separate people.

A contract is an agreement that specifies clear objectives, the required commitments of each party involved, a protocol for engagement, a way to assess, and terms by which the contract is voided.

Contracts use explicit, actionable language to avoid ambiguity. They assume respect, require individual integrity, and build mutual trust.

Contracts control how a player takes on a role.

Of the many things that contracts can do within the LOS, here are a few:

- Allow a player to commit to a role
- Define a learning task
- Propose a challenge
- Offer and provide support


## Contract Attributes

There are multiple types of contracts. All contracts share the same attributes, but will have different values for each.

Every contract contains (at minimum) the following attributes:

- Name
- Purpose
- Values
- Terms
  - Commitments
  - Success criteria
- Assessment method
- Statistics

## Contracts

### Investor-Learner Contract

#### Purpose

The purpose of the Investor-Learner contract is to codify the relationship between investor(s) and learner(s). Without an Investor-Learner contract in place, a Learner may not enter the game.

#### Values

TBD

<!-- TODO: figure out values -->

#### Terms

Any Learner invited to enroll into Learners Guild will receive from the Investor:

- A grant of $1,000 per month for the participation in the 2 month _trial period_.
- A loan of $2,000 per month for each month that they participate beyond the _trial period_, called the _engagement period_.

Not all Learners who participate in the _trial period_ will be receive funding from the Investor to continue into the _engagement period_. At the end of the _trial period_, an _assessment_ will be performed to determine their eligibility to enter the _engagement period_.

If the contract is _voided_ at any time during the _trial period_, any grant money received by the Learner must be refunded to the Investor.

The duration of _engagement period_ is flexible. The contract is deemed _closed_ when the Learner stops playing the game in order to pursue a full-time position of employment as a software engineer.

Once the contract is _closed_, Learners must repay any money borrowed during the _engagement period_, plus interest, as described in "Commitments" below.

Continuing in the _engagement period_ for 8 months will trigger a _reassessment_. This _reassessment_ of the Learner's statistics may render them ineligible to receive further funding. At such a point, the contract will be deemed _closed_.

##### Commitments

- A Learner must commit to the _trial period_ for the full 2 months.
  - If a Learner leaves the _trial period_ before 2 months have passed, the contract will be _voided_.
  - During the _trial period_, a Learner must be on-site, playing the game for a minimum of 40 hours per week.
- A Learner must commit to remain in the _engagement period_ until either:
  - a minimum of 8 months have passed, or
  - until a full-time employment position as a software engineer is accepted.
  - During the _engagement period_, a Learner must commit to being on-site, playing the game for a minimum of 40 hours per week.
- A Learner must commit to repaying the money borrowed, plus interest, once the contract is _closed_.
  - Interest will be calculated at an APR of 10%.
  - No interest will be accumulated until such time as the Learner obtains a full-time employment position with a salary at or above $50,000 per annum.

##### Success criteria

To transition from the _trial period_ to the _engagement period_, a Learner must demonstrate a minimum aptitude in the profession of software engineering. This aptitude will be assessed as described in "Assessment method" below.

Once a Learner has entered the _engagement period_, to successfully complete and _close_ the contract, a Learner must attain a full-time employment position as a software engineer.

#### Assessment method

The assessment of a Learner interested in transitioning from the _trial period_ to the _engagement period_ will be comprised of two components:

1. An objective evaluation:
  - Any in-game statistic that is more than two standard deviations worse than the mean for that statistic (computed on an ongoing basis for all Learners to ever have gone through the _trial period_).
  - At least 75% of the Learners who have worked with the Learner being evaluated must be willing to join a Team with the Learner (to be determined by a survey of all Learners who have worked with the Learner being evaluated).
2. Subjective interviews:
  - Every Learner in the _trial period_ must pass an interview process.
  - The interviewers will be Learners who are at least 6 months into their own _engagement period_ as Learners in the game.
  - Each interviewee will be interviewed by three different interviewers.
  - All interviewers must agree to move the interviewee from the _trial period_ to the _engagement period_.

The assessment that happens during the 8 month _reassessment_ will be an objective evaluation. Any in-game statistic that is more than two standard deviations worse than the mean for that statistic (computed on an ongoing basis for all Learners to ever reach 8 months in the _engagement period_).
