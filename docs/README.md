# Documentation

Documentation for the Learning Operating System (LOS).

The LOS is comprised of five components:

1. [Roles](roles.md)
2. [Contracts](contracts.md)
3. [Processes](processes.md)
4. [Statistics](statistics.md)
5. [Game Objects](game-objects.md)

Together these form the structure of the LOS and allow for our learning environment to flourish according to the design principles defined in our [blueprint](../blueprint/principles.md).

## Overview

Every person who interacts with the LOS takes on one or more **roles**.

Every role has a purpose, and they express their purpose by working on **contracts**.

These roles interact with the system by creating, committing to, engaging, and completing contracts. Contracts have clear goals and terms by which those goals may or may not be reached.

One or more roles may work with any given contract. The contracts ultimately determine how roles relate to themselves and to each other.

In order to work with contracts, there are several defined **processes**. At minimum, these processes will allow roles to interact with contracts at each stage of the _contract lifecycle_:

1. _Define_: generate a new contract
1. _Commit_: decide to accept the terms of a contract
1. _Engage_: work on a contract
1. _Close_: complete or abandon a contract

In addition, there are processes for roles to _assess_, _amend_, and _review_ a contract. These processes are not a part of the lifecycle, but are available for roles to use when necessary and appropriate.

Finally, the system tracks **statistics** about many of the activities happening within. For example, there could be statistics that track the abilities a Learner role has achieved through their work completing contracts (Skill Stat). Similarly, there could be statistics about how many contracts a Mentor role has completed (Mentorship Stat).


## Interacting with the LOS


### Working with Contracts

The contract is the core object in the LOS. It is a highly versatile and powerful tool for defining goals and protocols for relationships between roles.

At their essence, contracts are an agreement between two parties. In some cases, those two parties are the same person, in other cases they are one or more separate people.

A contract is an agreement that specifies clear objectives, the required commitments of each party involved, a protocol for engagement, a way to assess, and terms by which the contract is voided.

They use explicit, actionable language to avoid ambiguity. They assume respect, require individual integrity, and build mutual trust.

Contracts control how a person takes on a role.

Of the many things that contracts can do within the LOS, here are a few:

- Allow someone to commit to a role
- Define a learning task
- Propose a challenge
- Offer and provide support

### Using Processes

There are processes that dictate how roles interact with the system. These processes constrain and guide how people interact with the LOS.

The most basic processes are those that cover the ways roles interact with contracts:

- Definition process
- Commitment process
- Engagement process
- Closing process
- Assessment process
- Amendment process
- Voiding process

In addition, there may be specific processes that define how roles interact with each other:

- Feedback process (for roles to give feedback to each other)
- Help request process (for roles to request help from each other)
- ...

In other words, as a person interacting with the LOS, you can only take action via the available processes. They are the rules which govern the system.

### Measuring Statistics

Statistics are gathered from many places within the system. Their primary purpose is to give feedback to roles, in order to help roles answer questions like:

- What is my current state?
- How am I progressing toward my contract goals?
- Where am I in relation to other people in the system?
- How is the overall system doing?

Statistics, when used correctly, are the fuel that powers learning.
