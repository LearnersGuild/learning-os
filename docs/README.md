# Documentation

Documentation for the Learning Operating System (LOS).

The LOS is comprised of five components:

1. [Roles](roles.md)
2. [Contracts](contracts.md)
3. [Processes](processes.md)
4. [Statistics](statistics.md)
5. [Game Objects](game-objects.md)

Together these form the structure of the LOS and allow for our learning environment to flourish according to the design principles defined in our [blueprint](../blueprint/principles.md).

## Overview

Every person who interacts with the LOS takes on one or more **roles**.

Every role has a purpose, and they express their purpose by working on **contracts**.

These roles interact with the system by creating, committing to, engaging, and completing contracts. Contracts have clear goals and terms by which those goals may or may not be reached.

One or more roles may work with any given contract. The contracts ultimately determine how roles relate to themselves and to each other.

In order to work with contracts, there are several defined **processes**. At minimum, these processes will allow roles to interact with contracts at each stage of the _contract lifecycle_:

1. _Define_: generate a new contract
1. _Commit_: decide to accept the terms of a contract
1. _Engage_: work on a contract
1. _Close_: complete or abandon a contract

In addition, there are processes for roles to _assess_, _amend_, and _review_ a contract. These processes are not a part of the lifecycle, but are available for roles to use when necessary and appropriate.

Finally, the system tracks **statistics** about many of the activities happening within. For example, there could be statistics that track the abilities a Learner role has achieved through their work completing contracts (Skill Stat). Similarly, there could be statistics about how many contracts a Mentor role has completed (Mentorship Stat).
