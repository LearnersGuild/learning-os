# Investor Learner Contract

## Purpose

The purpose of the Investor-Learner contract is to codify the relationship between investor(s) and learner(s). Without an Investor-Learner contract in place, a Learner may not enter the game.

## Values

## Terms

The investor learner contract goes through 7 stages:

1. Trial Period


Any Learner invited to enroll into Learners Guild will receive from the Investor:

- A grant of $1,000 per month for the participation in the 2 month _trial period_.
- A loan of $2,000 per month for each month that they participate beyond the _trial period_, called the _engagement period_.

At the end of the _trial period_, the Learner will go through an _assessment_ to determine wether or not they move on to the _engagement period_.

The duration of _engagement period_ is flexible.

If a Learner wants to continue in the _engagement period_ for more than 8 months, they need to pass a _reassessment_. This _reassessment_ of the Learner may render them ineligible to receive further funding. At such a point, the contract will be deemed _closed_.

The contract is also _closed_ when the Learner stops playing the game in order to start working as a full time software engineer.

Once the contract is _closed_, Learners must repay any money borrowed during the _engagement period_, plus interest (see "Commitments" below).

## Commitments

- A Learner must commit to the _trial period_ for the full 2 months.
  - If a Learner leaves the _trial period_ before 2 months have passed, the contract will be _voided_ and any grant money received by the Learner must be refunded to the Investor
  - During the _trial period_, a Learner must be on-site, playing the game for a minimum of 40 hours per week.
- A Learner must commit to remain in the _engagement period_ until either:
  - a minimum of 8 months have passed, or
  - until a full-time employment position as a software engineer is accepted.
  - During the _engagement period_, a Learner must commit to being on-site, playing the game for a minimum of 40 hours per week.
- A Learner must commit to repaying the money borrowed, plus interest, once the contract is _closed_.
  - Interest will be calculated at a fixed APR of 10%.
  - No interest will be accumulated until such time as the Learner obtains a full-time employment position with a salary at or above $50,000 per annum.

## Success criteria

To transition from the _trial period_ to the _engagement period_, a Learner must demonstrate a minimum aptitude in the profession of software engineering. This aptitude will be assessed as described in "Assessment method" below.

Once a Learner has entered the _engagement period_, to successfully complete and _close_ the contract, a Learner must attain a full-time employment position as a software engineer.

## Assessment method

The assessment of a Learner interested in transitioning from the _trial period_ to the _engagement period_ will be comprised of two components:

1. An objective evaluation:
  - Any in-game statistic that is more than two standard deviations worse than the mean for that statistic (computed on an ongoing basis for all Learners to ever have gone through the _trial period_).
  - At least 75% of the Learners who have worked with the Learner being evaluated must be willing to join a Team with the Learner (to be determined by a survey of all Learners who have worked with the Learner being evaluated).
2. Subjective interviews:
  - Every Learner in the _trial period_ must pass an interview process.
  - The interviewers will be Learners who are at least 6 months into their own _engagement period_ as Learners in the game.
  - Each interviewee will be interviewed by three different interviewers.
  - All interviewers must agree to move the interviewee from the _trial period_ to the _engagement period_.

The assessment that happens during the 8 month _reassessment_ will be an objective evaluation. Any in-game statistic that is more than two standard deviations worse than the mean for that statistic (computed on an ongoing basis for all Learners to ever reach 8 months in the _engagement period_).
