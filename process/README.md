# Development Process

This section defines the framework for our design and development process. It addresses such questions as:

- How is the life cycle of a design idea?
- What is the process for proposing a new design idea?
- How do we frame our design discussions to be intentional without losing creative potency?

The design process is a cycle of addressing a design issue.

Design issues are stored and managed through the [\_Design Issues project][asana-design-issues] in Asana. Issues are created as tasks and discussion around issues happens primarily in the comment thread of the corresponding task.

## How to Engage With the Process

### Getting Your Bearings

1. Read about the [Seven Levels of Thought](seven-levels-of-thought.md) in which a design issue may exist.
2. Read about the [Versions](versions.md) of our pedagogy, and when they'll be rolled out.
3. Read about the [Five Phases](five-phases.md) that design elements traverse.
4. Read about how we use [Game Design](game-design.md) as a framework.
5. Read about how we use [Scrum](scrum.md) to manage our work together.

### Your Daily Practice

Now that you're familiar with the process as a whole, here's a quick "loop" that you can go through on a daily basis in order to help move design issues forward. You should _never_ feel like there isn't a way for you to help move things forward in the process. The "loop" below is a reminder that there's always a way to apply your brain to our shared list of design issues.

**NOTE:** The "loop" below focuses on moving the highest priority items (as defined by their [version](versions.md)) forward first.

#### The Steps of the "Loop":

1. If something is assigned to you in **Draft**, [do what it takes to move it to **Solid**](five-phases.md#user-content-draft-resolution-to-solid).
2. Heart issues in the **Backlog** that you feel passionate about.
3. Take one issue from **Backlog** that is hearted, then:
    1. [tag with version (e.g., `_v1`) and thought level, move to **No Resolution**](five-phases.md#user-content-backlog-to-no-resolution). _Remember that only issues that are `tl-design-element` need a version number_.
    2. if the issue is tagged with the current version (currently `_v0`), then:
        1. if you have a proposal for said issue, [document it and move it to **Draft**](five-phases.md#user-content-no-resolution-to-draft).
        2. if you believe someone might be able to help move it to **Draft**, tag her in a comment.
4. Find an issue (or more) that is in **Draft** that you feel passionate about, then:
    1. heart it (to let others know it matters to you)
    2. catch yourself up on comments on the issue
    3. add your own thoughts, if any, as comments on the issue
    4. if you believe someone might be able to help move the issue forward, tag her in a comment.
5. Repeat step 4 for an issue (or more) that is in **No Resolution** that you feel passionate about
6. Add new issues to **Backlog**
7. Go to step 1.

### Updating the Learning OS Blueprint

Issues that have reached or passed the Solid Resolution phase in Asana are effectively "live" and ought to become a part of the Learning OS Blueprint.

Any designer can move issues from Solid or Final Resolution to the Blueprint (this repository) by following this process:

1. Create a new branch
2. Add the content from the issue, making new files and directories as needed
3. Proofread and edit the new content as needed
4. Submit a pull request and get another learning designer to review it
5. Merge the pull request into the `master` branch
6. Add a link to the pull request as a comments on the issue in Asana so that the integration is logged
