# Seven Levels of Thought

Weâ€™ve adopted a method for organizing design ideas into 6 Levels of Thought. These levels are hierarchical, with higher levels having more influence over lower levels, and lower levels forming the substance of higher levels.

Each level of thought is associated with a particular tag on Asana.

The 7 levels are:

1. Belief
2. Philosophy
3. Principle
4. Concept
5. Design Strategy
6. Design Goal
7. Design Element


With an additional **Meta** level (tag: `_tl-meta`) for issues about the design process itself, not the actual learning design, and a **Test** level (tag: `_tl-test`) for issues that address how we will know the design is working. Example: "What qualities should our culture draw out of people?"

## Belief

Tag: `_tl-belief`

Highest thought level that informs everything. What are our core beliefs about how the world works and what the world is. What is our worldview. For example: "We believe that we are fundamentally connected, and therefore culture is the container for us becoming whole human beings"

## Philosophy

Tag: `_tl-philosophy`

How do we relate to these beliefs in terms of how we go about doing things. It's the belief applied to the design challenge. It defines the approach.

For example: "We deliberately cultivate awareness of the learning culture, and increase capability for sensing and co-creating it"

## Principle

Tag: `_tl-principle`

Grounds the belief and the philosophy in a Guide to Action. Starts with a verb.

For example: Align financial outcomes. Value external considering. Abstain from coercion.

## Concept

Tag: `_tl-concept`

A conceptual framework, or way of thinking about things, that's derived from the 3 top tier thought levels. Uses metaphor and analogy.

For example: Think of the learning unit as the pod, not the individual. Think of financial arrangements as investments, not loans. Think of the guild as an incubator, not a school. Think of culture as a co-created symphony, not a pre-cooked meal. Think of this room as a kitchen, not a restaurant.

## Strategy

Tag: `_tl-strategy`

How are we going to go about doing something? Usually expressed in "X over Y" where both X and Y are valuable.

For example: Scale over quality. is a strategy that's an expression of our belief "Everyone deserves a dignified livelihood" and our belief that "Amazing learning cultures can scale"

## Goal

Tag: `_tl-goal`

Goals express the outcomes and objectives of our design. They address the question of why we choose which elements to include, providing purpose. They will help us to know how and whether the game design and the player support are working.

For example: 80% of our graduates more than double their salaries from before to after graduation.

## Design Element

Tag: `_tl-design-element`

This is the holy grail. The actual design decision/component/element that constitutes our learning OS. These elements should be linked to a GTD Project that is assigned to someone who is responsible for developing them.

For example: Admissions Criteria. POD agreements. Mindfulness Curriculum.
